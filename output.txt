Counsel for Petitioner
QUESTION PRESENTED
The First Amendment's Religion Clauses forbid
government interference in a religious group's
selection of its ministerial employees. The federal
courts of appeals and state courts of last resort have
long agreed that the key to determining ministerial
status is whether an employee performed important
religious functions. This Court's unanimous 2012
ruling in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran
Church & School v. EEOC was consistent with that
existing analytical consensus, and other circuits and
states since 2012 have continued to rely on it. Yet the
Ninth Circuit has now twice ruled that, under
Hosanna- Tabor, important religious functions alone
can never suffice those functions must always be
accompanied by considerations such as a religious title
or religious training in order to demonstrate
ministerial status.
The question presented is:
Whether the Religion Clauses prevent civil courts
from adjudicating employment discrimination claims
brought by an employee against her religious
employer, where the employee carried out important
religious functions.

PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND
CORPORATE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
Petitioner St. James School was the defendant-
appellee below. Respondent Kristen Biel was the
plaintiff-appellant below. Ms. Biel passed away on
June 7, 2019 and her husband Darryl Biel, in his
capacity as the personal representative of her estate,
was substituted as the party to this case.
Petitioner St. James School has no parent
corporation and issues no stock. St. James School is a
canonical entity and part of the canonical parish of St.
James in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los
Angeles; civilly, St. James School is treated as an
unincorporated association under the corporate laws
of the State of California. The Archdiocese of Los
Angeles operates in the civil forum through several
religious corporations under the corporate laws of the
State of California; civilly, the real property and
related assets of St. James School and Parish are held
by and operated through certain of those corporations.

INTRODUCTION
In 2012, the Court decided Hosanna-Tabor
Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. EEOC,
recognizing the ministerial exception, a bedrock First
Amendment doctrine that bars civil courts from
adjudicating employment-related cases brought by
"ministerial" employees against their religious
employers. 565 U.S. 171 (2012). The Court's decision
was unanimous.
As we explained in the parallel petition pending
before this Court in Our Lady of Guadalupe School v.
Morrissey-Berru, No. 19-267, the lower courts
applying the ministerial exception have, with
remarkable consistency, focused on employees'
religious functions to determine their ministerial
status. Pet. at 18, Our Lady of Guadalupe (filed Aug.
28, 2019). Indeed, Justices Alito and Kagan identified
this consistency as reflecting a "functional consensus"
among the courts. Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 203
(Alito, J., concurring). Under that consensus, religious
functions are not the only analytical consideration, but
they are the touchstone.
The Ninth Circuit, however, has decided to go its
own way. In this case and in Morrissey-Berru, separate
panels of the Ninth Circuit concluded that important
religious functions could never be enough, by
themselves, to prove up an employee's ministerial
status.
Here, it was undisputed that Kristen Biel was
responsible for "transmitting the [Catholic] faith to the
next generation." Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 192.
Biel, who was Catholic, testified that she spent 200
minutes each week teaching her students about the
2
Catholic faith. She taught them the significance of
Lent and Easter; she instructed them on the
sacraments like the Eucharist and Reconciliation; and
she read them Scriptural accounts about Jesus. Twice
a day, she prayed prayers like the Hail Mary and the
Lord's Prayer with her students; every month she took
them to a school mass and prayed with them there as
well. Biel served as an embodiment of Catholic faith
and worship both in her life and in all of the other
academic subjects she taught. Yet, "although Biel
taught religion," a divided panel concluded that was
not enough because it did not include one of three
other considerations that factored into Hosaina-
Tabor's analysis: religious title, training, or tax
benefits. App 15a. Thus, since the panel majority
believed "only one of the four Hosanna-Tabor
considerations weighs in St. James's favor," it ruled
that the ministerial exception did not apply. App. 15a.
Nine judges on the Ninth Circuit later dissented
from this new approach, criticizing both the panel
majority and the later decision in Morrissey-Berru
which relied on it. App. 42a (R. Nelson, J., joined by
Bybee, Callahan, Bea, M. Smith, Ikuta, Bennett,
Bade, and Collins, JJ., dissenting from denial of
rehearing en banc). The dissenting judges called for
this Court to step in and correct the Ninth Circuit's
anomalous standard, which they identified as splitting
with numerous post-Hosanna-Tabor cases. And a few
weeks later, the Seventh Circuit's Sterlinski v.
Catholic Bishop of Chicago decision, written by Judge
Easterbrook, confirmed that the Ninth Circuit had
broken from the functional consensus. The split of
authority is thus deep, acknowledged, and absent
this Court's intervention-irreconcilable. 934 F.3d 568
(7th Cir. 2019).
3
Moreover, as the Biel dissenters recognized, the
stakes are high, not only for St. James and Our Lady,
but also for the thousands of schools and other
religious employers across the eleven states and
territories of the Ninth Circuit. Under the Ninth
Circuit's new "resemblance-to-Perich test," App. 50a
(R. Nelson, J., dissenting), those religious institutions
now must choose between giving up control of who
passes on their faith to the school children in their
charge or conforming themselves to the specific
Lutheran religious employment practices upheld in
Hosanna-Tabor. Either outcome would be deeply
unfair to schools, parents, and students.
Without correction, the Ninth Circuit's rule
promises to turn up the heat on church-state conflict
across the western United States and leaves religious
institutions subject to two starkly different First
Amendment standards depending on the accident of
geography. The question presented is thus one of
nationwide importance that only this Court can
resolve.
Finally, because the petition in Our Lady is already
pending and presents the same question as this case,
the Court may wish to grant the petition in Our Lady
and hold this petition pending disposition of that
appeal.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
IL Factual Background
A. Petitioner St. James School
St. James School is a Catholic parish school located
in Torrance, California. The school is a ministry of,
and is operated by, the parish of St. James under the
jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The
Archdiocese is a constituent entity of the Roman
Catholic Church and is the largest archdiocese in the
United States. It is headed by an Archbishop,
currently Archbishop Jos6 H. Gomez.
St. James was founded in 1918. The first teachers
were Sisters of the Order of St. Joseph of Carondelet,
and at the time of this lawsuit nearly 100 years later,
the school was still led by a religious sister. The
mission of St. James is to develop and promote a
Catholic faith community that reflects both a Catholic
philosophy of education and the doctrines, laws, and
norms of the Catholic Church. App. 19a.
B. The role of teachers at St. James
Teachers have an important role in carrying out St.
James's religious mission. Teachers are expected to
"personally demonstrate [their] belief in God," to
"delight in and enjoy our noble position as Catholic
educators," and to "actively take part in worship-
centered school events." App. 19a. Teachers must
agree to perform "all" of their "duties and
responsibilities" in a manner consistent with Catholic
doctrine and educational philosophy. App. 19a.
Teachers apply "the values of Christian charity,
temperance, and tolerance" to all their interactions
with others at the school, App. 97a, "guide the
spiritual formation of the student[,]" and "help each
child strengthen his/her personal relationship with
God." App. 20a. Teachers are also expected to
participate in St. James's liturgical activities,
App. 19a, to begin and end each school day with
prayer, App. 110a, to teach students specific prayers
each month of the school year, App. 110a, and to
prepare their students to be "active participants" in
regularly-scheduled school-wide masses, App. 109a.
In light of these responsibilities, St. James prefers to
hire teachers that are practicing Catholics, App. 4a,
and all teachers are required to "model, teach, and
promote behavior in conformity to the teaching of the
Roman Catholic Church." App. 19a.
To ensure these expectations are met, they are
written into each teacher employment contract, which
6
itself must be signed by the parish pastor and renewed
annually. App. 98a, 101a. Teachers are also evaluated
on whether their teaching "infus[es] 'Catholic values
through all subject areas and whether their
classrooms visibly reflect the "sacramental traditions
of the Roman Catholic Church." App. 83a-84a, 106a.
C. Biel's role at St. James
Kristen Biel began teaching full-time at St. James
in 2013. App. 4a. Although she had been a substitute
teacher in the past, this was her first full-time
teaching position. App. 4a.
Biel was Catholic, and she understood that, as a
Catholic school, St. James had the goal of "promot[ing]
and develop[ing] the Catholic faith" among its
students. App. 92a. She also understood that, as a
teacher at St. James, she was responsible for
incorporating the Catholic faith into the curriculum.
App. 92a.
Biel fulfilled this commitment in several ways.
Most prominently, she taught religion classes four
days a week. App. 82a. Biel was required to spend a
minimum of 200 minutes each week teaching her
students about the Catholic faith. App. 50a. In these
classes, she taught her students about:
" the sacraments of the Catholic Church
including the Eucharist and confession,
" the lives of Catholic Saints,
* Catholic prayers,
* Catholic social teaching,
* Gospel stories, and
7
.Catholic holy days like Lent and Easter.
App. 18a.
In addition to teaching religion classes, Biel
displayed Catholic sacramental symbols throughout
her classroom. App. 18a. She was also required to
incorporate Catholic values and traditions in all the
other subjects taught in her classroom. App. 19a.
Further, Biel modeled and practiced the Catholic
faith by taking part in school-based religious worship.
She testified that she prayed prayers like the Lord's
Prayer and the Hail Mary with her students twice
each day. App. 93a. She attended school masses with
her students every month, where twice a year her
students participated by presenting the Eucharistic
gifts. App. 34a. Biel testified that, during these
monthly masses, she also prayed with her students.
App. 81a, 95a-96a.
To ensure her students properly understood the
religious beliefs which she taught and modeled, Biel
regularly gave her students religious tests. App. 83a.
And to ensure that she was properly teaching Catholic
beliefs, St. James regularly evaluated her teaching of
the Catholic faith across all subjects. App. 32a. St.
James also required her to attend the Los Angeles
Religious Education Congress, a day-long conference
for Catholic teachers that included training in how to
incorporate God into their teaching. App. 30a.
D. St. James declines to renew Biel's contract
Two weeks into the 2013-14 school year, St.
James's principal, Sister Mary Margaret Kreuper,
noticed that Biel's classroom was disorganized and
noisy. App. 85a. Thus, while Biel's first and only
8
formal performance review noted that, for instance,
she was displaying Catholic symbols in her classroom,
she was also counseled to improve her classroom
management. App. 5a-7a.
Biel's classroom management did not improve. As
the year went on, teachers and administrators at St.
James observed that Biel's classroom was "chaotic"
and "often out of control." App. 85a, 120a-121a, 112a.
Books and papers were seen in the aisles and children
"crawling on the floor." App. 114a. Janell O'Dowd, a
teacher at St. James whose daughter was also a
student in Biel's classroom, confirmed that Biel's
classroom was "very loud, noisy," and that Biel's
failure to correct her daughter's work made it difficult
for her daughter to prepare for tests. App. 114a-115a.
By January 2014, Biel was called into weekly meetings
with school administrators about her classroom
performance and told that it would be difficult to offer
her a contract for the following school year. App. 85a-
86a, 87a-89a.
Following Easter break in April 2014, Biel told
Sister Mary Margaret that she had breast cancer and
that May 22 would be her last day teaching so that she
could pursue treatment. App. 88a-91a. Sister Mary
Margaret expressed sympathy and noted that she, too,
was being treated for breast cancer. App. 90a-91a. Biel
remained employed at St. James through the end of
her 2013-2014 contract. However, St. James decided
not to renew Biel's contract for the 2014-2015 school
year. App. 5a-7a.
9
IL. The proceedings below
A. Biel's complaint
Biel filed charges with the EEOC in December
2014 and was issued a right-to-sue letter in March
2015. Biel then sued in federal district court, alleging
that St. James's decision not to renew her contract
violated the ADA. App. 5a-7a.
After discovery, St. James filed a motion for
summary judgment. App. 5a-7a. The district court
granted the motion, ruling that Biel's claim was
barred by the First Amendment's ministerial
exception. App. 5a-7a. It found that St. James was
undisputedly a religious organization protected by the
exception. App. 71a-73a. Thus, "the application of the
ministerial exception turn[ed] on whether Biel was a
'minister."' App. 71a.
The court found that she qualified because she
"conveyed the Catholic Church's message by teaching
religion to her students," "by administering and
evaluating weekly tests from a Catholic textbook," and
"by praying with the students twice each day."
App. 73a. The court also observed that Biel herself
"clearly sought to carry out St. James's Catholic
mission by, for example, including Catholic teachings
into all of her lessons and attending a conference to
learn techniques for incorporating religious teachings
into her lessons." App. 73a. The court noted that Biel's
case did not "contain all of the hallmarks of ministry
identified in Hosanna-Tabor," but concluded that
Hosanna-Tabor "was not intended to represent the
outer limits of the ministerial exception." App. 73a.
The court ruled that Biel was a minister and granted
summary judgment for St. James. App. 73a.
10
Biel appealed.
B. Ninth Circuit proceedings
On appeal, the EEOC appeared and presented oral
argument as an amicus curiae supporting Biel,
asserting among other things that courts since
Hosanna-Tabor have applied the exception only to
those employees in a "spiritual leadership role." Biel v.
St. James School, No. 17-55180, Dkt. No. 25 at 24
(EEOC brief filed Sep. 27. 2017).
A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed.
App. 4a-5a. The panel majority held that Biel's
religious duties were, taken alone, insufficient to
invoke the ministerial exception, and that the
exception was ordinarily applied to those with
"religious leadership" roles while "Biel's role in
Catholic religious education" was "limited to teaching
religion from a book." App. 13a, 14a.
Judge D. Michael Fisher, sitting by designation,
dissented, opining that "Biel's duties as the fifth grade
teacher and religion teacher are strikingly similar to
those in Hosanna-Tabor," and that the panel
majority's conclusions were also in clear conflict with
a recent decision of the Seventh Circuit. App. 32a
(citing Grussgott v. Milwaukee Jewish Day School,
Inc., 882 F.3d 655, 661 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 139 S.
Ct. 456 (2018)). Judge Fisher further warned that the
majority's approach, such as downplaying religious
doctrinal instruction as merely "teaching *** from a
book," improperly "invites the very analysis the
ministerial exception demands we avoid" and causes
judicial "entanglement in the affairs of religious
organizations." App. 13a, 34a-35a.
11
St. James filed a petition for rehearing en bane.
While that petition was still pending, a different panel
of the Ninth Circuit followed Biel's analysis to rule
against Our Lady of Guadalupe School, a Catholic
school in a neighboring parish that was also being
sued by a fifth-grade teacher. Morrissey-Berru v. Our
Lady of Guadalupe School, 769 F. App'x 460 (9th Cir.
2019). The panel agreed that the teacher's
"significant" religious duties included that she had
"committed to incorporate Catholic values and
teachings into her curriculum," and that she "led her
students in daily prayer, was in charge of the liturgy
planning for a monthly Mass, and directed and
produced a performance by her student's during the
School's Easter celebration every year." Id. at 461.
But, in the panel's view, all of this was insufficient
because Biel instructs that "an employee's duties alone
are not dispositive." Ibid. Our Lady of Guadalupe
School filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this
Court on August 28, 2019. See No. 19-267, Our Lady
of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru.
On June 25, 2019, the Ninth Circuit denied the
petition for rehearing en banc. Nine judges dissented,
stating that Biel's analysis "poses grave consequences
for religious minorities" and "conflicts with Hosanna-
Tabor, decisions from our court and sister courts,
decisions from state supreme courts, and First
Amendment principles." App. 42a (R. Nelson, J.,
dissenting). The dissent noted that the panel decision
had already been relied on in Morrissey-Berru to cut
back on the ministerial exception's protections, and
observed that "[i]n each successive case, we have
excised the ministerial exception, slicing through
constitutional muscle and now cutting deep into core
12
constitutional bone." App. 44a (citing Morrissey-Berru,
769 F. App'x at 460).
On June 7, 2019, during the pendency of the en
banc petition, Biel passed away. On July 3 the panel
substituted Darryl Biel, as personal representative of
Biel's estate, as the appellant. App. 69a.
REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION
I. The Ninth Circuit and the California Court of
Appeal are in a square, deep, and
acknowledged split with the "functional
consensus" approach to ministerial
exception analysis adopted by seven other
federal circuits and seven state courts of last
resort.
The Ninth Circuit's rule "embraces the narrowest
construction" of the Religion Clauses' protection for
religious autonomy, which "splits from the consensus
of our sister circuits" and "decisions from state
supreme courts" that "[ani employee's ministerial
function should be the key focus." App. 42a (R. Nelson,
J., dissenting). Under the Ninth Circuit's standard, a
religious organization's employee can hold a
ministerial role only if he has a religious title, training,
or tax status, regardless of the religiously important
functions of his position. That rigid approach, now also
adopted by a California intermediate appellate court,
conflicts with this Court's decision in Hosanna-Tabor
and splits with the precedent of the Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and D.C. Circuits and
courts of last resort in Connecticut, Kentucky,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Wisconsin,
and the District of Columbia.
13
A. Prior to Hosanna-Tabor, the lower courts
consistently focused on function in
determining ministerial status.
The ministerial exception was first applied in
McClure v. Salvation Army, 460 F.2d 553 (5th Cir.
1972). The Fifth Circuit held that "the application of
the provisions of Title VII to the employment
relationship existing between * * * a church and its
minister would result in an encroachment by the State
into an area of religious freedom which it is forbidden
to enter ***" Id. at 560.
In the four decades between the ministerial
exception's inception in 1972 and the Court's first
application of it in 2012 (in Hosanna-Tabor), the
overwhelming majority of Circuits and state supreme
courts "ha[d] concluded that the focus should be on the
'function of the position"' in "evaluating whether a
particular employee is subject to the ministerial
exception." Petruska v. Gannon Univ., 462 F.3d 294,
304 n.6 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting Ray burn v. Gen.
Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists, 772 F.2d 1164,
1168 (4th Cir. 1985) (Wilkinson, J.), and collecting
cases from the D.C., Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh
Circuits). See also Hollins v. Methodist Healthcare,
Inc., 474 F.3d 223, 226 (6th Cir. 2007) (identifying
function-focused analysis as the "general rule"); EEOC
v. Catholic Univ. of America, 83 F.3d 455, 463 (D.C.
Cir. 1996) (employee was minister where her "primary
functions serve [the religious employer's] spiritual and
pastoral mission"); Dayner v. Archdiocese of Hartford,
23 A.3d 1192, 1204 (Conn. 2011) (courts must
"objectively examine an employee's actual job
function, not her title, in determining" ministerial
status), overruled on other grounds in Hosanna-Tabor,
14
565 U.S. at 195 n.4; Coulee Catholic School v. Labor &
Indus. Review Comm'n, 768 N.W.2d 868, 881 n.16
(Wis. 2009) ("The focus *** should be on the function
of the position, not the title or a categorization of job
duties"); Pardue v. Center City Consortium School of
Archdiocese of Washington, Inc., 875 A.2d 669, 675
(D.C. 2005) (inquiry focuses on "function of the
position" and "not on categorical notions of who is or is
not a 'minister.'); Archdiocese of Washington v.
Moersen, 925 A.2d 659, 672 (Md. 2007) (emphasizing
"the function of the position"); Alicea v. New
Brunswick Theological Seminary, 608 A.2d 218, 222
(N.J. 1992) (ministerial exception protects decisions
"regarding employees who perform ministerial
functions").
B. In Hosanna-Tabor, this Court acted
consistently with the "functional
consensus" identified by Justices Alito
and Kagan as the governing ministerial
exception standard in the lower courts.
In Hosanna-Tabor, the Court addressed the
ministerial exception for the first time, confirming
that the First Amendment protects the relationship
between religious ministries and their ministers from
government interference. See Hosanna-Tabor, 565
U.S. at 187-188 & n.2 (collecting cases). This
protection is rooted in both Religion Clauses: "The
Establishment Clause prevents the Government from
appointing ministers, and the Free Exercise Clause
prevents it from interfering with the freedom of
religious groups to select their own." Id. at 184.
The ministerial exception is a component of the
Religion Clauses' broader religious autonomy
protections, which trace their roots back over 140
15
years of Supreme Court precedent, Hosanna-Tabor,
565 U.S. at 185-186 (citing Watson v. Jones, 80 U.S.
(13 Wall.) 679, 727 (1872)), and before that to Magna
Carta, id. at 182. These protections benefit both
church and state by preventing government
entanglement in internal religious affairs. Together,
the Religion Clauses ensure religious groups
"independence from secular control or manipulation"
by reserving to them the "power to decide for
themselves, free from state interference, matters of
church government as well as those of faith and
doctrine." Id. at 186 (quoting Kedroff v. Saint Nicholas
Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in N. Am., 344
U.S. 94, 116 (1952)).
Hosanna-Tabor affirmed that this independence
includes the selection of ministers. As the Court
explained, the Religion Clauses ensure "that the
authority to select and control who will minister to the
faithful-a matter strictly ecclesiastical, Kedroff, 344
U.S. at 119-is the church's alone." Hosanna-Tabor,
565 U.S. at 194-195 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Even over "undoubtedly important" societal
interests, such as employment discrimination
statutes, "the First Amendment has struck the
balance" in favor of allowing each religious group
autonomy to "be free to choose those who will guide it
on its way." Id. at 196; accord id. at 201 (Alito, J.,
concurring) ("A religious body's control over
[ministers] is an essential component of its freedom to
speak in its own voice[.]").
For its first foray into the ministerial exception,
this Court declined to "adopt a rigid formula" to
determine ministerial status. Hosanna-Tabor, 565
U.S. at 190. Rather, it was sufficient to resolve the
16
case at hand that "all the circumstances" of
respondent Cheryl Perich's employment as a fourth-
grade teacher at a Lutheran school showed that she
was a minister. Ibid. The Court identified four
"considerations" supporting its conclusion: Perich's
(1) "formal title," (2) "the substance reflected in that
title," (3) her "use of th[e] title," and (4) "the important
religious functions she performed." Id. at 192. These
considerations were enough to achieve the ministerial
exception's core purpose: protecting "religious groups
in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their
faith, and carry out their mission." Id. at 196. The
Court left other questions for another day, holding
that "[t] here will be time enough to address the
applicability of the exception to other circumstances if
and when they arise." Ibid.
Justice Thomas concurred, cautioning against
misbegotten "[j]udicial attempts to fashion a civil
definition of 'minister"' through a "bright-line test or
multi-factor analysis" that would be insensitive to our
nation's robust "religious landscape." Hosanna-Tabor,
565 U.S. at 197 (Thomas, J., concurring). Likewise,
and in light of that religious diversity, Justices Alito
and Kagan warned that "the important issue of
religious autonomy" would be harmed if courts made
the "mistake" of focusing on such religiously variable
factors as an employee's title. Id. at 198 (Alito, J.,
concurring). Rather, the Justices emphasized that the
Court's unanimous decision was consistent with the
pre-existing "functional consensus" in the lower courts
that the focus of ministerial exception analysis should
be "on the function performed by persons who work for
religious bodies." Id. at 198, 203 (Alito, J., concurring).
And under that consensus, "religious authorities must
be free to determine who is qualified to serve in
17
positions of substantial religious importance," such as
"those who are entrusted with teaching and conveying
the tenets of the faith." Id. at 200 (Alito, J.,
concurring).
C. After Hosanna-Tabor and before this case,
the lower courts consistently focused on
function to determine ministerial status.
After Hosanna-Tabor was decided, the Second,
Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits, along with
Massachusetts and Kentucky, continued to follow the
"functional consensus" identified by Justices Alito and
Kagan.
The Fifth Circuit decided the first post-Hosanna-
Tabor ministerial exception appeal. In Cannata v.
Catholic Diocese of Austin, Judge Dennis, joined by
Judges Davis and Haynes, explained that
"[a]pplication of the exception *** does not depend on
a finding that [the employee] satisfies the same
considerations that motivated the [Supreme] Court to
find that Perich was a minister." 700 F.3d 169, 177
(5th Cir. 2012). Rather, it was "enough" to conclude
that an employee "played an integral role" in worship
services and thereby "furthered the mission of the
church and helped convey its message." Ibid. That is,
the employee was a minister "because [he] performed
an important function during the service." Id. at 180
(emphasis added).
The Second Circuit took the same tack. In Fratello
v. Archdiocese of New York, Judge Sack, joined by
Judges Lohier and Woods, explained that "'courts
should focus' primarily 'on the function [s] performed
by persons who work for religious bodies."' 863 F.3d
190, 205 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Hosanna-Tabor, 565
18
U.S. at 198 (Alito, J., concurring)) (emphasis added).
The court stressed that this kind of objective approach
was necessary to avoid judicial entanglement in
deciding religious questions:
Judges are not well positioned to determine
whether ministerial employment decisions rest
on practical and secular considerations or
fundamentally different ones that may lead to
results that, though perhaps difficult for a
person not intimately familiar with the religion
to understand, are perfectly sensible and
perhaps even necessary-in the eyes of the
faithful. In the Abrahamic religious traditions,
for instance, a stammering Moses was chosen to
lead the people, and a scrawny David to slay a
giant.
Id. at 203.
In Lee v. Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church, the
Third Circuit likewise focused on functions, with
Judges Shwartz, Rendell, and Roth confirming that
"the ministerial exception 'applies to any claim, the
resolution of which would limit a religious institution's
right to choose who will perform particular spiritual
functions."' 903 F.3d 113, 122 n.7 (3d Cir. 2018)
(quoting Petruska, 462 F.3d at 299) (emphasis added).
And Judge Batchelder explained for the Sixth
Circuit that "the ministerial exception clearly applies"
where (a) the religious group "identifies an individual
as a minister" in "good-faith"-which the court
understood as the basic equivalent of the "title"
consideration-and (b) the individual engages in
important religious functions. Conion v. Inter Varsity
Christian Fellowship, 777 F.3d 829, 835 (6th Cir.
19
2015) (emphasis added). Given the presence of both a
good-faith ministerial designation and "important
religious functions," Conlon found that it did not need
to reach the question of whether function alone would
demonstrate ministerial status. Ibid.
State supreme courts applying Hosanna-Tabor
also joined the "functional consensus." The
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was first,
confirming that function alone can suffice to prove
ministerial status in certain cases. Temple Emanuel of
Newton v. Massachusetts Comn m'n Against
Discrimination, 975 N.E.2d 433, 443 (Mass. 2012). In
that case, "[a]ll that [wa]s plain from the record [wa]s
that [the plaintiff] taught religious subjects at a school
that functioned solely as a religious school[.]" Id. at
486. The court said there was no evidence with respect
to the other three Hosanna-Tabor considerations, but
nevertheless held that the ministerial exception
barred the plaintiffs claim. Ibid.
The Kentucky Supreme Court later agreed that in
considering the totality of the circumstances, courts
should give "more" focus to the "actual acts or
functions conducted by the employee," and avoid the
"danger of hyper-focusing" on considerations such as
title. Kirby v. Lexington Theological Seminary, 426
S.W.3d 597, 613 & n.61 (Ky. 2014).
D. The Ninth Circuit rejected the functional
consensus, first in this case and then in
Morrissey-Berru.
This chorus of agreement among the lower courts
was brought to a screeching halt by the two-judge
majority in this case. App. 4a-5a. The panel majority
held that Biel's religious duties were insufficient alone
20
to invoke the ministerial exception, and that the
exception was ordinarily applied to those with
"religious leadership" roles while "Biel's role in
Catholic religious education" was "limited to teaching
religion from a book." App. 13a. The panel majority
also parted ways with Grussgott. Grussgott, like
Hosanna-Tabor, found that an elementary-level
teacher who taught religion was a minister. 882 F.3d
at 662. The panel majority expressly questioned the
validity of the Seventh Circuit's unanimous panel
decision before trying to distinguish it based on some
specific training that Grussgott had received.
App. 12a-14a. Judge D. Michael Fisher, sitting by
designation, dissented, opining that "Biel's duties as
the fifth grade teacher and religion teacher are
strikingly similar to those in Hosanna-Tabor," and
that "this case is not distinguishable from
Grussgott[.]" App. 29a (Fisher, J., dissenting).
Five months later, while the petition for en banc
review of this case was still pending, the Ninth Circuit
applied Biel in Morrissey-Berru. The court reversed
the district court's grant of summary judgment to Our
Lady of Guadalupe School, finding it legally
insufficient that the teacher in that case, Agnes
Morrissey-Berru, had "significant religious
responsibilities as a teacher at the School." 769 Fed.
App'x 460, 461 (9th Cir. 2019). The court squarely
acknowledged that Morrisey Berru:
committed to incorporate Catholic values and
teachings into her curriculum, as evinced by
several of the employment agreements she
signed, led her students in daily prayer, was in
charge of liturgy planning for a monthly Mass,
and directed and produced a performance by
21
her students during the School's Easter
celebration every year.
Ibid. (noting further that she had taken a "course on
the history of the Catholic church"). But all of that was
legally inadequate, the court explained, because the
Ninth Circuit rule provides that "an employee's duties
are not dispositive under Hosanna-Tabor's
framework." Ibid.
Two months after the ruling in Morrissey-Berru,
nine judges dissented from denial of rehearing en banc
in this case. They explained that review was urgently
necessary because the Ninth Circuit's new rule not
only "conflicts with Hosanna-Tabor, decisions from
our court and sister courts, decisions from state
supreme courts, and First Amendment principles," but
it also "poses grave consequences for religious
minorities *** whose practices don't perfectly
resemble the Lutheran tradition at issue in Hosanna-
Tabor." App. 42a-43a (R. Nelson, J., dissenting). They
explained that the rule conflicts with Hosanna-Tabor
because it puts this Court's flexible analysis into a
"resemblance-to-Perich" straitjacket that "[i]gnor[es]
the warnings of Justices Alito and Kagan (and Justice
Thomas)" against making matters that "relate to [an
employee's] title" dispositive. App. 50a, 54a. Similarly,
the rule "diverged from the function-focused approach
taken by our court previously, our sister courts, and
numerous state supreme courts," instead "embrac[ing]
the narrowest reading of the ministerial exception."
App. 53a; see also App. 64a (noting that other Circuits
"pay closer attention to function, particularly in
religious educational settings," and citing to
Grussgott, Fratello, and Conlon).
22
The dissenting judges warned that the panel's
narrow interpretation "threatens the autonomy of
minority groups" that do not use Lutheran-sounding
titles but for whom religious education is a '"critical
means of propagating the faith, instructing the rising
generation, and instilling a sense of religious
identity.' App. 43a-44a (quoting religious minorities'
amicus brief). "Indeed," the dissenting judges
explained, "requiring a religious group to adopt a
formal title or hold out its ministers in a specific way"
is blatantly unfaithful to First Amendment values: it
"inherently violates the Establishment Clause" and "is
the very encroachment into religious autonomy the
Free Exercise Clause prohibits." App. 55a.
A California appellate court recently applied the
reasoning in this case in Su v. Stephen Wise Temple,
32 Cal. App. 5th 1159 (2019), rehearing denied, Apr. 2,
2019, review denied, June 19, 2019. There, the court
acknowledged that the Temple's preschool teachers
"play an important role in the life of the Temple" and
"in transmitting Jewish religion and practice to the
next generation," because they are "responsible for
implementing the school's Judaic curriculum by
teaching Jewish rituals, values, and holidays, leading
children in prayers, celebrating Jewish holidays, and
participating in weekly Shabbat services." Id. at 1168.
But, tracking the Ninth Circuit's new rule, the court
denied the ministerial exception to the Temple
because the clear showing of religious function failed
absent proof of religious title or training. Ibid.1

abeyance while Ihe Temple prepares to s;eek cert iorari. Order, Su
v. Stephen Wise Temp/e, No. B275216 (Cal. Ct. App., 2d Dist.
23
E. The Seventh Circuit has recognized the
split with the Ninth Circuit.
In Sterlinski v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, the
Seventh Circuit reaffirmed the functional consensus,
sharply rejected the Ninth Circuit's new rule, and
recognized the extant split of authority. See 934 F.3d
at 570-571. Writing for a unanimous panel, Judge
Easterbrook explained that the Ninth Circuit's
approach "asks how much like Perich a given plaintiff
is, rather than whether the employee served a
religious function." Id. at 570; see also App. 50a (R.
Nelson, J., dissenting) (new Ninth Circuit standard is
a "resemblance-to-Perich test"). Judge Easterbrook
noted that the dissenting judges in Biel "disagreed
with that approach-as do we." Sterlinski, 934 F.3d at
570. Instead, the Seventh Circuit had already
"adopted a different approach" in Grussgott, and
"[m]any judges, not just our panel in Grutssgott (and
the nine dissenters in Biel)" rejected a Perich-
comparison analysis in favor of maintaining the focus
on religious functions. Ibid. (citing Fratello and
Cannata as supporting examples).
Sterlinski identifies that last point as the place
where the Ninth Circuit parts ways from all others.
Keeping the focus on whether an "employee served a
religious function" advances the "two goals" of the
ministerial exception: protecting "a religious body's
'right to shape its own faith and mission through its
appointments,"' and prohibiting "'government
involvement in such ecclesiastical decisions."'
Sterlinski, 934 F.3d at 570 (quoting Hosanna-Tabor,
June 25, 2019) recallingg and trying remittitur pending the
filing nd dispose ition of'petition for certiorari).
24
565 U.S. at 188-189). And where religious functions
are fairly shown, civil judges cannot turn to other
considerations in an effort to second-guess how "vital"
the functions are "to advance [the] faith." Ibid. It was
"precisely to avoid such judicial entanglement in, and
second-guessing of, religious matters that the Justices
established the rule of Hosanna-Tabor." Id. at 570-571
(also noting that the Ninth Circuit's rule
impermissibly "embraced" requiring "independent
judicial resolution of ecclesiastical issues").
F. Only this Court can resolve the split.
As Sterlinski and the Biel dissenters recognize, the
Ninth Circuit's rigid formula is at war with the more
sensitive approach of this Court and every other
Circuit and state supreme court to decide the issue.
Thumbing its nose at the functional consensus, the
Ninth Circuit's approach flatly finds that it is never
enough to show an employee carried out core religious
functions such as "teaching and conveying the tenets
of the faith to the next generation." Hosanna-Tabor,
565 U.S. at 200 (Alito, J., concurring). Rather, at least
one of the other three specific Hosanna-Tabor
considerations must obtain. That strict "function-plus-
one" test is inconsistent both with this Court's explicit
refusal to adopt a "rigid formula" and with its
command that the purpose of the exception is to serve
"the interest of religious groups in choosing who will
preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out
their mission." Id. at 190, 196. As the Second Circuit
explained, "Hosanna-Tabor instructs only as to what
we might take into account as relevant, including the
four considerations on which it relied; it neither limits
the inquiry to those considerations nor requires their
25
application in every case." Fratello, 863 F.3d at 204-
205 (emphasis in original).
Tallying the precedents puts the Ninth Circuit and
the California Court of Appeal at odds with seven
other Circuits and seven state supreme courts over the
importance of function to ministerial exception
analysis. Given the failed en banc vote here, there is
no prospect that the split on this important First
Amendment issue will be resolved without this Court's
intervention.
II. The scope of the ministerial exception is a
vital and recurring question of nationwide
importance for thousands of religious
organizations and individuals.
Review is especially warranted because of the
sweeping practical significance and nationwide
importance of the First Amendment question
presented. That question is not only frequently
recurring and vital to the daily operations of religious
organizations, but getting it right is crucial in
protecting church-state relations.
1. One reason the issue is of nationwide importance
is its frequency of occurrence. Conflicts over the scope
of the ministerial exception arise regularly in the
lower courts. As shown above, lower appellate courts
have repeatedly had occasion to apply the ministerial
exception since this Court's 2012 decision in Hosanna-
Tabor. If anything, the number of conflicts is
increasing: in 2018, for the first time since at least
2011, litigation over clergy firings became one of the
26
top five annual reasons that houses of worship end up
in court.2
One reason for this increase may be that this Court
left many of the exact contours of the ministerial
exception for a later day. See Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S.
at 196. Lower courts have sometimes found this
"limited direction" difficult, noting that Hosanna-
Tabor "is not without its Delphic qualities." Fratello,
863 F.3d at 204-205; see also J. Gregory Grisham and
Daniel Blomberg, The Ministerial Exception After
Hosanna-Tabor: Firmly Founded, Increasingly
Refined, 20 Federalist Soc'y Rev. 80, 84 (2019) (survey
of post-Hosanna-Tabor rulings finding that "courts
have sometimes struggled analytically to determine
what to do with the Supreme Court's four
'considerations' for determining ministerial status").
But, until the Ninth Circuit's detour, that confusion
had not resulted in a deep and acknowledged split
requiring review.
2. Another reason that the scope of the ministerial
exception is of nationwide importance is the sheer
number and variety of religious groups that are
affected. A robust ministerial exception is a crucial
protection for religious organizations of all sorts.
For example, the ministerial exception protects
religious groups of many different faith traditions.

See, e.g., Hosanna-Tabor (Lutheran); Grussgott
(pluralistic Jewish); Conlon (non-denominational
Protestant); Temple Emanuel (Conservative Jewish);
Fratello (Catholic); El-Farra v. Sayyed, 226 S.W.3d
792, 795-796 (Ark. 2006) (Muslim); Sixth Mount Zion
(Missionary Baptist); Kirby (Disciples of Christ); Su
(Reform Jewish); Rayb urn (Seventh-day Adventist);
Alicea (Reformed Christian); Puri v. Khalsa, 844 F.3d
1152 (9th Cir. 2017) (Sikh).
And it protects many different kinds of religious
employers beyond houses of worship. See, e.g., Yin v.
Columbia Int'l Univ., 335 F. Supp. 3d 803 (D.S.C.
2018) (religious university); Shaliehsabou v. Hebrew
Home of Greater Washington, Inc., 363 F.3d 299 (4th
Cir. 2004) (nursing home); Penn v. New York
Methodist Hospital, 884 F.3d 416 (2d Cir.), cert.
denied, 139 S. Ct. 424 (2018) (hospital); Grussgott (day
school); Con lon (campus student organization). As a
heuristic for the large number of institutions affected,
over three-quarters of the nation's PK-12 students
attending private schools do so at religiously-affiliated
institutions, meaning one in thirteen American
schoolchildren attends a religious school. See Council
for American Private Education, FAQs About Private
Schools, "Schools and Students."
The need to resolve the conflict is particularly
pressing for the large number of religious
organizations and schools-not to mention parents
and schoolchildren-within the Ninth Circuit. As a
result of the Ninth Circuit's rule, and its subsequent
adoption in Su, "thousands" of Catholic, Jewish, and
other religious schools in the Ninth Circuit "now have
less control over employing [their] elementary school
teachers of religion than in any other area of the
28
country" and "less religious freedom than their
Lutheran counterparts nationally." App. 67a. (R.
Nelson, J., dissenting).
3. A third reason that the question presented is of
nationwide importance is that properly calibrating the
scope of the ministerial exception is vital to sensitive
church-state relations. Courts have long warned that
ministerial exception cases must be handled in a way
that avoids "entanglement [that] might *** result
from a protracted legal process pitting church and
state as adversaries." Rayburn, 772 F.2d at 1171. But
as Sterlinski and the nine Biel dissenters explained,
the Ninth Circuit's approach inevitably leads to
"judicial resolution of ecclesiastical issues" that
"subject[s] religious doctrine to discovery and, if
necessary, jury trial." Sterlinski, 934 F.3d at 570-571;
see also App. 42a (R. Nelson, J., dissenting). Even "the
mere adjudication of such questions would pose grave
problems for religious autonomy." Hosanna-Tabor,
565 U.S. at 205-206 (Alito, J., concurring). "It is not
only the conclusions that may be reached by the
[government agency] which may impinge on rights
guaranteed by the Religion Clauses, but also the very
process of inquiry." NLRB v. Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S.
490, 502 (1979). Thus, this Court has long forbidden
that sort of second-guessing: "church and state
litigating in court about what does or does not have
religious meaning touches the very core of the
constitutional guarantee against religious
establishment." New York v. Cathedral Academy, 434
U.S. 125, 133 (1977).
The Ninth Circuit's rule will also have perverse
effects. It will interfere in religious governance by
pressuring religious groups, "with an eye to avoiding
29
litigation or bureaucratic entanglement rather than
upon * * * their own * * * doctrinal assessments," to
slap religious-sounding (or at least religious-sounding
to a court) titles onto positions that already include
important religious functions. Raybiurn, 772 F.2d at
1171; see also Corporation of Presiding Bishop of
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos,
483 U.S. 327, 336 (1987) ("[I]t is a significant burden
on a religious organization to require it, on pain of
substantial liability, to predict which of its activities a
secular court will consider religious."). It would also
"in effect penalize religious groups for allowing
laypersons to participate in their ministries" and thus
incentivize "bar[ring] laity from substantial 'roles in
conveying the [group's] message and carrying out its
mission."' Fratello, 863 F.3d at 207 (quoting Hosanna-
Tabor, 565 U.S. at 192).
Finally, left uncorrected, the Ninth Circuit's rule
will impermissibly discriminate among religions. It
will particularly discriminate against religious
minority groups that do not use titles such as
"minister" and thus would always be at a
disadvantage. See Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 198
(Alito, J., concurring). Similarly, it will enable
religious discrimination by allowing some titles to be
deemed religious ("rabbi") and others secular
("teacher"), based on common secular understandings
rather than religious ones. Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S.
228, 244 (1982) ("The clearest command of the
Establishment Clause is that one religious
denomination cannot be officially preferred over
another"); see also App. 55a (R. Nelson, J., dissenting)
("a demand for ecclesiastical titles inherently violates
the Establishment Clause"). Indeed, in this case, Biel
argued that the title of "teacher" in a Catholic school
30
was nonreligious, but that "if Biel's position was in the
Mormon faith," then "the title of 'teacher"' would have
judicially cognizable "religious significance." See Biel
v. St. James School, No. 17-55180, Dkt. No. 43 at 12 &
n.2 (Appellant's reply brief filed Feb. 9, 2018).
The ministerial exception is a fundamental part of
the architecture of church-state relations in this
country. The Ninth Circuit's aberrant rulings have
severely weakened this critical constitutional
protection across a wide swath of the nation, while
creating a deep and acknowledged split of authority
that can be resolved only by this Court.
CONCLUSION
The Court should grant the petition. Since the
petition in No. 19-267, Our Lady of Guadalupe School
v. Morrissey-Berru, and this petition both present the
same question and the petition in Our Lady is already
pending, the Court may wish to grant the petition in
Our Lady and hold this petition pending disposition of
that appeal.

SUMMARY**
Employment Discrimination
The panel reversed the district court's summary
judgment in favor of the defendant and remanded in
an employment discrimination action under the Amer-
icans with Disabilities Act.
Based on the totality-of-the-circumstances test ar-
ticulated by the Supreme Court in Hosatnna-Tabor
Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. E.E.O.C.,
565 U.S. 171 (2012), the panel held that the First
Amendment's ministerial exception to generally appli-
cable employment laws did not bar a teacher's claim
against the Catholic elementary school that termi-
nated her employment. The panel concluded that she
did not qualify as a minister for purposes of the excep-
tion. The panel considered whether the school held the
teacher out as a minister, whether her title reflected
ministerial substance and training, whether she held
herself out as a minister, and whether her job duties
included important religious functions.
Dissenting, Judge Fisher wrote that, considering
all of the circumstances of the teacher's employment,
she was a "minister" for the purposes of the ministerial
exception because of the substance reflected in her ti-
tle and the important religious functions she per-
formed.

OPINION
FRIEDLAND, Circuit Judge:
Plaintiff Kristin Biel was fired from her fifth grade
teaching position at St. James Catholic School after
she told her employer that she had breast cancer and
would need to miss work to undergo chemotherapy.
She now appeals the district court's summary judg-
ment ruling that her subsequent lawsuit against St.
James under the Americans with Disabilities Act
("ADA") was barred by the First Amendment's "minis-
terial exception" to generally applicable employment
laws. We hold that, assessing the totality of Biel's role
at St. James, the ministerial exception does not fore-
close her claim. We therefore reverse and remand for
further proceedings.
I.
Biel received a bachelor's degree in liberal arts and
a teaching credential from California State Univer-
sity, Dominguez Hills. After graduating in 2009, Biel
worked at two tutoring companies and as a substitute
teacher at several public and private schools. St.
James, a Roman Catholic parish school within the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, hired Biel in March 2013
as a long-term substitute teacher. At the end of that
school year, St. James's principal hired Biel as the
school's full-time fifth grade teacher. Biel is herself
Catholic, and St. James prefers to hire Catholic teach-
ers, but being Catholic is not a requirement for teach-
ing positions at St. James. Biel had no training in
Catholic pedagogy at the time she was hired. Her only
such training was during her tenure at St. James: a
single half-day conference where topics ranged from
5a
the incorporation of religious themes into lesson plans
to techniques for teaching art classes.
Biel taught the fifth graders at St. James all their
academic subjects. Among these was a standard reli-
gion curriculum that she taught for about thirty
minutes a day, four days a week, using a workbook on
the Catholic faith prescribed by the school administra-
tion. Biel also joined her students in twice-daily pray-
ers but did not lead them; that responsibility fell to
student prayer leaders. She likewise attended a
school-wide monthly Mass where her sole responsibil-
ity was to keep her class quiet and orderly.
Biel's contract stated that she would work "within
[St. James's] overriding commitment" to Church "doc-
trines, laws, and norms" and would "model, teach, and
promote behavior in conformity to the teaching of the
Roman Catholic Church." St. James's mission state-
ment provides that the school "work[s] to facilitate the
development of confident, competent, and caring Cath-
olic-Christian citizens prepared to be responsible
members of their church[,] local[,] and global commu-
nities." According to the school's faculty handbook,
teachers at St. James "participate in the Church's mis-
sion" of providing "quality Catholic education to ...
students, educating them in academic areas and in .. .
Catholic faith and values."1 The faculty handbook fur-
ther instructs teachers to follow not only archdiocesan
The di-sent quotes exten sively from) the faculty handbiook to
support its argument about the extent of Biel's religious role. It
does so as if there is no dispute that the handbook impose ed bind-
ing requirement son Bie's employment and provided an accurate
depiction of her duties. But St. James did not rely on the fac ulty
handbook in support of its motion for surnmary judgment, which
might have been because the handbook's force and effect were
contested-it is at least unclear what role, if any, the handbook
6a
curricular guidelines but also California's public-
school curricular requirements.
In November 2013, Biel received a positive teach-
ing evaluation from St. James's principal, Sister Mary
Margaret, measuring her performance in aspects both
secular (e.g., her lesson planning strategies) and reli-
gious (e.g., displaying Church symbols in her class-
room). The principal's written evaluation praised
Biel's "very good" work promoting a safe and caring
learning environment, noted that she adapted her
teaching methods to accommodate her students' var-
ied learning styles, and observed that she encouraged
social development and responsibility. The principal
also identified some areas for improvement: for in-
stance, Biel's students had many items on their desks
and two students were coloring in the pages of their
books.
Less than six months after that evaluation-which
was her first and only formal evaluation at St.
James-Biel learned that she had breast cancer and
informed the school administration that her condition
required her to take time off to undergo surgery and
chemotherapy. Sister Mary Margaret told Biel a few
weeks later that she would not renew Biel's contract
for the next academic year, citing her belief that Biel's
"classroom management" was "not strict" and that "it
played at the school and whether it actually reflected what teach-
ers at the school were expected to do in practice. For example,
Biel's employment agreement ref renced "policies in the faculty
handbook," but said that "the policies do not constitute a contrac-
t ual agreement wit h [Biell." At this sta ae of the proceedings, any
factual uncertainties mus t be viewed in Biels favor. See Feno
Motors, LL v. Mercede B,,He USA, LLC, 77 F. 3d 1119, 1125
(9th Cir. 2014).
7a
was not fair ... to have two teachers for the children
during the school year."
Biel sued St. James in the United States District
Court for the Central District of California, alleging
that her termination violated the ADA, which prohib-
its employment discrimination based on disability. See
42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Following discovery, St. James
moved for summary judgment, arguing that the First
Amendment's ministerial exception to generally appli-
cable employment laws barred Biel's ADA claims. The
district court agreed and granted summary judgment
for St. James.
II.
We review de novo a district court's grant of sum-
mary judgment. Brunozzi v. Cable Commc'ns, Inc., 851
F.3d 990, 995 (9th Cir. 2017). We also apply de novo
review to determinations of law as well as to mixed
questions of law and fact that implicate the Religion
Clauses. Pur v. Khalsa, 844 F.3d 1152, 1157 (9th Cir.
2017).
III.
A.
Religious organizations enjoy a broad right to se-
lect their own leaders. The Supreme Court confirmed
in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &
School v. E.E.0.C. that, as part of that right, the First
Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise
Clauses "bar the government from interfering with the
decision of a religious group to fire one of its minis-
ters." 565 U.S. 171, 181 (2012); see also U.S. Const.
amend. I. The Court grounded this principle in a
longstanding historical and jurisprudential concern
8a
with "political interference" in "matters of church gov-
ernment as well as those of faith and doctrine." Id. at
184, 186 (citations omitted). When the ministerial ex-
ception applies, it categorically bars an employee's suit
under otherwise generally applicable employment
laws. Puri v. Khalsa, 844 F.3d 1152, 1164 (9th Cir.
2017). When the ministerial exception does not apply,
"courts [may] decide disputes involving religious or-
ganizations," so long as they, in accordance with the
Religion Clauses, proceed "'without resolving [any] un-
derlying controversies over religious doctrine."' Id.
(quoting Maktab Tarighe Oveyssi Shah Maghsoudi,
Inc. v. Kianfar, 179 F.3d 1244, 1248 (9th Cir. 1999)).
These principles guide our analysis here.
Biel does not dispute that St. James, as a part of
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, is the
type of religious organization that could potentially in-
voke the ministerial exception as a defense. The disa-
greement here is over whether Biel's employment fell
within the exception.
In Hosanna-Tabor, the Supreme Court expressly
declined to adopt "a rigid formula for deciding when an
employee qualifies as a minister," and instead consid-
ered "all the circumstances of [the plaintiff's] employ-
ment." 565 U.S. at 190. Hosanna-Tabor is the only
case in which the Supreme Court has applied the min-
isterial exception, so its reasoning necessarily guides
ours as we consider the circumstances here.
Hosanna-Tabor involved a former teacher at a Lu-
theran school, Cheryl Perich, who alleged that the
school fired her in violation of the ADA after she was
diagnosed with narcolepsy. Id. at 178-79. The Court
focused on four major considerations to determine if
9a
the ministerial exception applied: (1) whether the em-
ployer held the employee out as a minister,
(2) whether the employee's title reflected ministerial
substance and training, (3) whether the employee held
herself out as a minister, and (4) whether the em-
ployee's job duties included "important religious func-
tions." Id. at 192. Based on the totality of the circum-
stances, the Court concluded that Perich qualified as
a minister for purposes of the ministerial exception.
First, the evangelical Lutheran church that oper-
ated the school in Hosanna-Tabor "held Perich out as
a minister, with a role distinct from that of most of its
members." Id. at 191. Its congregation granted her the
title of "Minister of Religion, Commissioned" after
electing her to that position. Id. In conjunction with
that commission, the "congregation undertook to peri-
odically review Perich's 'skills of ministry' ...and to
provide for her 'continuing education as a professional
person in the ministry of the Gospel."' Id.
Second, to be eligible to become a commissioned
minister, Perich needed a substantial amount of reli-
gious training. She "had to complete eight college-level
courses in subjects including biblical interpretation,
church doctrine, and the ministry of the Lutheran
teacher" and pass an oral examination by a Lutheran col-
lege faculty committee. Id. She also had to obtain the
endorsement of her local Lutheran synod by submit-
ting letters of recommendation, a personal statement,
and "written answers to various ministry-related
questions." Id. These training requirements took
Perich six years to complete.
Because of her status as a commissioned minister,
Perich was eligible for, and succeeded in obtaining, a
special category of teaching position: that of a "called"
la
teacher. Id. at 177-78. In contrast to "lay" teachers
who had one-year renewable terms, called teachers
had open-ended contracts that "could be rescinded
only for cause and by a supermajority vote of the con-
gregation." Id at 177. The school hired lay teachers
only when called teachers were unavailable, even
though all teachers performed the same duties in the
classroom. Id.
Third, Perich "held herself out as a minister of the
Church." Id. at 191. She claimed a federal tax benefit
reserved for employees "earning their compensation"
in "the exercise of the ministry." Id. at 192. And she
described herself as "feel[ing] that God [was] leading
[her] to serve in the teaching ministry." Id.
Fourth, Perich had an "important role in transmit-
ting the Lutheran faith to the next generation." Id. at
192. In addition to teaching her fourth grade students
various secular and religious subjects, Perich led them
in prayer three times a day. Id. Twice a year, she also
led a school-wide chapel service at which she "cho[se]
the liturgy, select[ed] the hymns, and deliver[ed] a
short message based on verses from the Bible." Id.
Only after describing all of these aspects of Perich's
position did the Supreme Court hold: "In light of these
considerations the formal title given Perich by the
Church, the substance reflected in that title, her own
use of that title, and the important religious functions
she performed for the Church-we conclude that
Perich was a minister covered by the ministerial ex-
ception." Id.
Biel, by contrast, has none of Perich's credentials,
training, or ministerial background. There was no re-
ligious component to her liberal studies degree or
11a
teaching credential. St. James had no religious re-
quirements for her position. And, even after she began
working there, her training consisted of only a half-
day conference whose religious substance was limited.
Unlike Perich, who joined the Lutheran teaching min-
istry as a calling, Biel appears to have taken on teach-
ing work wherever she could find it: tutoring compa-
nies, multiple public schools, another Catholic school,
and even a Lutheran school.
Nor did St. James hold Biel out as a minister by
suggesting to its community that she had special ex-
pertise in Church doctrine, values, or pedagogy beyond
that of any practicing Catholic. St. James gave her the
title "Grade 5 Teacher." Her employment was at-will
and on a yearlong renewable contract, unlike Perich's
unlimited term that could only be ended by a super-
majority vote of the congregation. The dissent's analy-
sis of Biel's title focuses on her duties at the school
as opposed to her education, qualifications, and em-
ployment arrangement-and thus improperly col-
lapses considerations that the Supreme Court treated
separately.2 Looking only to what the Court treated as
relevant to evaluating a job title, there is nothing reli-
gious "reflected in" Biel's title. Hosanna-Tabor, 565
U.S. at 192. In contrast to Perich's "Minister of Reli-
gion, Commissioned," and "called" teacher titles, it

12a
cannot be said that Grade 5 Teacher "conveys a reli-
gious-as opposed to secular-meaning."3 Conlon v.
Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship, 777 F.3d 829, 834-
35 (6th Cir. 2015).
Also in contrast to Perich, nothing in the record in-
dicates that Biel considered herself a minister or pre-
sented herself as one to the community. She described
herself as a teacher and claimed no benefits available
only to ministers.
Only with respect to the fourth consideration in
Hosanna-Tabor do Biel and Perich have anything in
common: they both taught religion in the classroom.
Biel taught lessons on the Catholic faith four days a
week. She also incorporated religious themes and sym-
bols into her overall classroom environment and cur-
riculum, as the school required. We do not, however,
read Hosanna-Tabor to indicate that the ministerial
exception applies based on this shared characteristic
alone. If it did, most of the analysis in Hosanna-Tabor
would be irrelevant dicta, given that Perich's role in
teaching religion was only one of the four characteris-
tics the Court relied upon in reaching the conclusion
that she fell within the ministerial exception.
And even Biel's role in teaching religion was not
equivalent to Perich's. In Hosanna-Tabor, the Su-
preme Court emphasized the importance of assessing
both the amount of time spent on religious functions

(2012) (Aito, I. concurring). But, lik the Supr me Court in //b-
,anna-Tabor, we look to her tit le as shorthand for "the subs;tance
reflected in that tit le." Id. at 192.
13a
and "the nature of the religious functions performed."
565 U.S. at 194 (emphasis added); see also id. at 204
(Alito, J., concurring) ("What matters is that [the indi-
vidual] played an important role as an instrument of
her church's religious message and as a leader of its
worship activities."). Biel's role in Catholic religious
education was limited to teaching religion from a book
required by the school and incorporating religious
themes into her other lessons. Whereas Perich orches-
trated her students' daily prayers, Biel's students
themselves led the class in prayers. Biel gave students
the opportunity to lead the prayers and joined in, but
she did not teach, lead, or plan these devotions herself.
Similarly, while Perich crafted and led religious ser-
vices for the school, Biel's responsibilities at St.
James's monthly Mass were only "to accompany her
students," and "[tlo make sure the kids were quiet and
in their seats." These tasks do not amount to the kind
of close guidance and involvement that Perich had in
her students' spiritual lives.
B.
St. James argues that we should reach a contrary
conclusion in light of the Seventh Circuit's recent de-
cision in Grussgott v. Milwaukee Jewish Day School,
Inc., 882 F.3d 655 (7th Cir. 2018), which held that the
ministerial exception barred a Hebrew teacher's em-
ployment discrimination suit against a Jewish pri-
mary school that fired her after she was diagnosed
with a brain tumor. Even assuming Grussgott was cor-
rectly decided, which we are not sure it was, the plain-
tiff in Grussgott more closely resembled Perich than
Biel does. Although the plaintiff in Grussgott lacked a
formal religious title, she had obtained a certification
14a
in a Jewish curricular program called Tal Am-a cur-
riculum that involved integrating religious teachings
into Hebrew lessons, as the Seventh Circuit noted in
its analysis of the plaintiff's job title. Id. at 659. The
plaintiff had also "tout[ed] significant religious teach-
ing experience," which "was a critical factor in the
school hiring her." Id. at 659. She also prayed and per-
formed rituals with her students. Id. at 660. For the
reasons discussed above, Biel's role was less ministe-
rial than that of the plaintiff in Grussgott.
The other post-Hosanna-Tabor cases on which St.
James relies are likewise not analogous to this one. All
of the plaintiffs in those cases had responsibilities that
involved pronounced religious leadership and guid-
ance.4 In contrast, although Biel taught religion, the
other considerations that guided the reasoning in Ho-
sanna-Tabor and its progeny are not present here. Biel
did not have ministerial training or titles. And she nei-
ther presented herself as nor was presented by St.
See, e.g., Frutello z. Arhdiocese of New York, 86; F.d 190 20;-
08 (2d Cir. 2017) (principal who oversaw daily prayer. s, uper-
vised planning for Masses, delivered religious speeches. nd was

James as a minister. At most, only one of the four Ho-
sanna-Tabor considerations weighs in St. James's fa-
vor. No federal court of appeals has applied the minis-
terial exception in a case that bears so little resem-
blance to Hosanna-Tabor. See, e.g., Grussgott, 882
F.3d at 661 (applying exception where "two of the four
Hosanna-Tabor factors are present"); Conlon, 777 F.3d
at 835 (same). We decline St. James's invitation to be
the first.
C.
A contrary rule, under which any school employee
who teaches religion would fall within the ministerial
exception, would not be faithful to Hosanna-Tabor or
its underlying constitutional and policy considera-
tions. Such a rule would render most of the analysis in
Hosanna-Tabor irrelevant. It would base the exception
on a single aspect of the employee's role rather than
on a holistic examination of her training, duties, title,
and the extent to which she is tasked with transmit-
ting religious ideas.
Such a rule is also not needed to advance the Reli-
gion Clauses' purpose of leaving religious groups free
to "put their faith in the hands of their ministers." Ho-
sanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 188. As the Supreme Court
recounted in Hosanna-Tabor, the historical episodes
that motivated the adoption of the Religion Clauses in-
cluded struggles over whether the choice of parish
ministers would be made by local vestries or instead
by the British monarch, the Bishop of London, or colo-
nial governors. Id. at 183. The Court likewise cited
First Amendment architect James Madison's opinion
that the President ought to have no role in the appoint-
ment of the Catholic Church's leadership in the terri-
tory of the Louisiana Purchase. Id. at 184. Although
16a
the Supreme Court held that "the ministerial excep-
tion is not limited to the head of a religious congrega-
tion," id. at 190, the focus on heads of congregations
and other high-level religious leaders in the historical
backdrop to the First Amendment supports the notion
that, to comport with the Founders' intent, the excep-
tion need not extend to every employee whose job has
a religious component.5
The First Amendment "insulates a religious organ-
ization's 'selection of those who will personify its be-
liefs."' Puri, 844 F.3d at 1159 (quoting Hosanna- Tabor,
565 U.S. at 188). But it does not provide carte blanche
to disregard antidiscrimination laws when it comes to
other employees who do not serve a leadership role in
the faith. We cannot read Hosanna-Tabor to exempt
from federal employment law all those who intermin-
gle religious and secular duties but who do not "preach

For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the dis-
trict court's grant of summary judgment to St. James
and REMAND.6
FISHER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:
This appeal concerns whether Kristen Biel, a fifth
grade teacher at a Roman Catholic elementary school,
was a "minister" for the purposes of the ministerial ex-
ception. Contrary to the majority, I conclude that Biel
was a minister. As a result, I would affirm the District
Court's decision that Biel is barred from bringing an
action against St. James under the Americans with
Disabilities Act.

the ADA because its stated pedagogical and classroom manage-
ment concerns-not Biel' medical condition were the ba sis for

I
During Biel's one year of service as a full-time fifth
grade teacher at St. James, her duties included teach-
ing religion as well as secular subjects. She taught 30-
minute religion classes four days a week. In her reli-
gion class, she used the curriculum from Coming to
God's Life, a Catholic textbook chosen by the school
principal, Sister Mary Margaret. Using that curricu-
lum, Biel taught and tested the students in her reli-
gion class about the Catholic sacraments, the lives of
Catholic Saints, Catholic prayers, Catholic social
teaching, Gospel stories, and church holidays. In her
secular classes, she was expected to incorporate Cath-
olic teachings. She attended, as required by the school,
a one day conference at the Los Angeles Religious Ed-
ucation Congress that covered methods of incorporat-
ing God into lessons.
To get a complete picture of Biel's role at St. James,
we look at various documents concerning her employ-
ment, including her employment contract, perfor-
mance review, and the faculty handbook.1 Biel signed
an employment contract with St. James which indi-
cated that her title was "Grade 5 Teacher." By signing
the contract, Biel indicated that she understood that
St. James's mission was "to develop and promote a
' The faculty handbook is specific ly referenced in Biel's employ-
ment count react: You shall be fa miliar with, and comply wit h the
School personnel policies and procedures... including policies
in the faculty handbook." The handbook provides insight into St.
James's expectations for facuhy at the school. Lik, Biel's perfor-
m nce review, Ihe handbook i a reflect ion of the role St. Lames
intended Biel to fill. Regardless of whet her it imposed cont ret ual
obligations on Bil , it is helpful to our determination of whether
the relationship between Biel and t. dames was that of a minis-
ter and church or merely an employee-employer relationship.
19a
Catholic School Faith Community within the philoso-
phy of Catholic education as implemented at [St.
James], and the doctrines, laws, and norms of the
Catholic Church." The contract also imposed several
requirements on Biel, mandating that she:
* perform "[a]ll duties and responsibilities .. .
within [St. James's] overriding commitment
[to developing the faith community],"
* "model, teach, and promote behavior in con-
formity to the teaching of the Roman Catho-
lic Church,"
* and "participate in School activities includ-
ing School liturgical activities, as requested."
Sister Mary Margaret conducted an observational
review of Biel's teaching performance during her first
semester as the fifth grade teacher. Her review in-
cluded a section evaluating "Catholic Identity Factors"
in which she noted that there was "visible evidence of
signs, sacramental [sic], traditions of the Roman Cath-
olic Church in the classroom," and that the "[c]urricu-
lum include[d] Catholic values infused through all
subject areas."
In the Faculty/Staff Handbook, the school's mission
statement was supplemented by nine "basic values"
guiding the school faculty, including:
* Faith -"To personally demonstrate our be-
lief in God ...to actively take part in wor-
ship-centered school events"; and
* Joy -"To delight in and enjoy our noble posi-
tion as Catholic educators...."
20a
The handbook also included the "Code of Ethics for
Professional Educators in Catholic Schools" which ex-
plained that "[e]ducation has always been one of the
most important missions of the Church. Its success de-
pends upon the professional competence, quality, and
commitment of the teacher who chooses to teach in a
Catholic school." This Code of Ethics detailed various
commitments that Catholic school teachers in the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles were expected to fulfill. It
explained that "Catholic school educators ...are
called to: Promote the peace of Christ in the world,"
and to:
Seek and encourage persons who live a life con-
sonant with gospel values and Catholic Church
teachings [and] pursue the apostolate of teach-
ing through the following:
-modeling the faith life and witness to the
Faith Community on the parish, diocesan, na-
tional, and world levels;
-exemplifying the teachings of Jesus Christ by
dealing with children and adults in true love
and justice.
In a section titled "Statement of Principles," the
handbook listed "religious development" as one of the
five goals of a St. James Catholic education. To achieve
this goal, "[the staff] guide the spiritual formation of
the student. ..and hope to help each child strengthen
his/her personal relationship with God." The hand-
book further explained that staff implement that goal
by:
Teaching the Gospel message and Catholic doc-
trine in such a way as to make them relevant to
everyday life ... Integrating Catholic thought
21a
and principles into secular subjects ...Cele-
brating regularly scheduled Masses and sea-
sonal prayer ... Encouraging student partici-
pation in liturgical services ... Providing op-
portunities for developing personal prayer and
shared prayer in the classroom.
In April of her year as the fifth grade teacher, Biel
was diagnosed with breast cancer. She informed Sister
Mary Margaret of the diagnosis and that she would
begin treatments in May. As described in the majority
opinion, Sister Mary Margaret informed Biel that St.
James would not renew her contract. Biel filed suit un-
der the ADA, and St. James moved for summary judg-
ment, relying on the ministerial exception. The Dis-
trict Court found the ministerial exception barred
Biel's claims and granted the motion. Biel filed this
appeal.
II
The ministerial exception is an affirmative defense
that "precludes application" of employment discrimi-
nation laws, like the ADA, to "claims concerning the
employment relationship between a religious institu-
tion and its ministers." Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical
Lutheran Church & Sch. v. E.E.O.C., 565 U.S. 171, 188
(2012). I agree with the majority, that the Supreme
Court's holding and reasoning in Hosanna-Tabor
guides our analysis here.
The ministerial exception flows from the First
Amendment; "[t]he Establishment Clause prevents
the Government from appointing ministers, and the
Free Exercise Clause prevents it from interfering with
the freedom of religious groups to select their own." Id.
22a
at 184. The exception bars discrimination claims be-
cause "the ministerial relationship lies so close to the
heart of the church that it would offend the Free Exer-
cise Clause simply to require the church to articulate
a religious justification for its personnel decisions."
Bollard v. Cal. Province of the Soc'y of Jesus, 196 F.3d
940, 946 (9th Cir. 1999); see also N.L.R.B. v. Catholic
Bishop of Chi., 440 U.S. 490, 502 (1979) (In discussing
jurisdiction over religious schools, the Court observed
"[i]t is not only the conclusions that may be reached by
the Board which may impinge on rights guaranteed by
the Religion Clauses, but also the very process of in-
quiry leading to findings and conclusions.").
The purpose of the exception is to "ensure[] that the
authority to select and control who will minister to the
faithful-a matter 'strictly ecclesiastical'-is the
church's alone." Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 194-95
(citation omitted) (quoting Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Ca-
thedral of Russian Orthodox Church in N. Am., 344
U.S. 94, 119 (1952)). Selection of such persons is a
"core matter of ecclesiastical self-governance with
which the state may not constitutionally interfere."
Bollard, 196 F.3d at 946.2
2 The majority sulgst that because the ADA and Title VII lack
a religious organization exempt ion, courts must t ake care not t o
i'allidate unneces sarily vast swat hs of federal law as applied to
many employees of religious orga nizat ions'." Maij. Op. at 15 n.5.
llowever, the ministerial exception is grounded in the First
Amendment and operates independently of any exception
granted by congress .In Bol/crd, we hel that "[dle spit the lck
of a ;t at ut ory hasis for t he ministerial except ion, and despite 'on-

rowin construction" to prevent 'constitutionally impermissible

The term "minister" is a term of art broader than
the word's ordinary meaning. It "encompasses more
than a church's ordained ministers." Alcazar v. Corp.
of the Catholic Archbishop of Seattle, 627 F.3d 1288,
1291 (9th Cir. 2010). This is especially important be-
cause in our religiously diverse society, the ministerial
exception recognized in Hosanna-Tabor must trans-
cend the Protestant Christian concept of "ministers" to
protect self-governance of all organizations of religious
purpose. Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 198 (Alito, J.,
concurring).
In Hosanna-Tabor, the teacher was a minister
within the Protestant Christian framework, serving at
an Evangelical Lutheran church and school. Courts
must take care to apply the principles from Hosanna-
Tabor without discounting ministerial relationships in
contexts that do not bear the obvious linguistic mark-
ers that were available for the Court's consideration in
Hosanna-Tabor. The ministerial exception "insulates
a religious organization's 'selection of those who will
personify its beliefs"' regardless of whether they bear
the standard markers of a minister. Pui v. Khalsa,
844 F.3d 1152, 1159 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Hosanna-
Tabor, 565 U.S. at 188). The totality of the circum-
stances approach serves that end, and "[a]s the Su-
preme Court has made clear, there is no 'rigid formula
for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minis-
ter."' Id. (quoting Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 190).
To determine whether Biel is a minister for pur-
poses of the exception, I proceed in three parts. First,
interference by the government." 19G F. 3d at 945. We must apply
the mini trial exception in this ca s "in order to reconcile the
Statute with the Constitution" regardless of whether the ADA
contains an exception. Id. at 947.
24a
I will summarize and examine the Supreme Court's
analysis of the exception in Hosanna-Tabor. Second, I
will consider how to weigh the four Hosanna-Tabor
factors in the context of this case. Finally, I consider
all of the circumstances of Biel's employment and con-
clude that the ministerial exception applies.
A Analytical framework provided by the Su-
preme Court in Hosanna-Tabor
In Hosanna-Tabor, the Supreme Court concluded
that a "called teacher" at a Lutheran elementary
school was a minister for the purposes of the ministe-
rial exception. 565 U.S. at 190. The Court evaluated
"all the circumstances of her employment." Id. Within
that totality of the circumstances approach, the Court
considered four factors: "[1] the formal title given [to
the teacher] by the Church," which the majority de-
scribes as whether the employer held out the employee
as a minister, "[2] the substance reflected in that title,
[3] her own use of that title, and [4] the important re-
ligious functions she performed for the Church." Id. at
192. These factors indicate the importance of fact-in-
tensive analysis in the application of the ministerial
exception.
Justice Alito, joined by Justice Kagan, concurred to
clarify that the employee's function, rather than his or
her title or ordination status, is the key. Hosanna-Ta-
bor, 565 U.S. at 198 (Alito, J., concurring). He went on
to write that the exception "should apply to any 'em-
ployee' who ... serves as a messenger or teacher of [the
organization's] faith." Id. at 199. He explained that
"[r]eligious autonomy means that religious authorities
must be free to determine who is qualified to serve in
positions of substantial religious importance," which
includes "those who are entrusted with teaching and
25a
conveying the tenets of the faith to the next genera-
tion." Id. at 200. Finally, Justice Alito described the
previous approach of the appellate courts, including
this Court, as a functional approach looking more at
the functions of individuals than at their titles, and
concluded that "[t]he Court's opinion today should not
be read to upset this consensus." Id. at 204.
Justice Thomas also concurred, explaining that, in
his view, courts applying the ministerial exception
must "defer to a religious organization's good-faith un-
derstanding of who qualifies as its minister." Id. at 196
(Thomas, J., concurring). Justice Thomas reasoned
that a "religious organization's right to choose its min-
isters would be hollow.. .if secular courts could sec-
ond-guess the organization's sincere determination
that a given employee is a 'minister."' Id. at 197. This
approach, he maintained, best serves the goals of the
Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses because it
does not risk causing religious groups-especially
those outside of the mainstream-"to conform [their]
beliefs and practices regarding 'ministers' to the pre-
vailing secular understanding" for fear of being denied
the exception. Id. (citing Corp. of Presiding Bishop of
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos,
483 U.S. 327, 336 (1987)).
Since the publication of Hosanna-Tabor, we and
other circuits have relied on a "totality-of-the-circum-
stances test." Grussgott v. Milwaukee Jewish Day
Sch., Inc., 882 F.3d 655, 661 (7th Cir. 2018), cert. de-
nied, __ S. Ct. __ (2018); see Pur, 844 F.3d at 1160
(holding that, on the pleadings, the exception did not
apply because of insufficient proof of religious duties,
lack of presentation of the individuals as religious
26a
leaders, and absence of religious substance in the po-
sitions); Conlon v. InterVarsity Christian Fellowship,
777 F.3d 829, 835 (6th Cir. 2015) (finding only two of
the four factors applicable, but still holding that the
"ministerial exception clearly applies"); Fratello v.
Archdiocese of New York, 863 F.3d 190, 204-05 (2d Cir.
2017) ("Hosanna-Tabor ... neither limits the inquiry
to [the four factors it enumerates] nor requires their
application in every case."). I will do the same here.
B. The Four Factors
i. Formal title
Biel argues that she is not a minister because noth-
ing in her formal title, Grade 5 Teacher, reflects a min-
isterial role. "[A]n employee is more likely to be a min-
ister if a religious organization holds the employee out
as a minister by bestowing a formal religious title."
Pun, 844 F.3d at 1160. In Hosanna-Tabor, this factor
weighed in favor of applying the exception because the
school employed both "lay" and "called" teachers, and
the plaintiff was "called." 565 U.S. at 177-78. "When
Hosanna-Tabor extended her a call, it issued her a 'di-
ploma of vocation' according her the title 'Minister of
Religion, Commissioned."' Id. at 191. Here, Biel never
received any diploma or commissioning from the par-
ish comparable to the teacher in Hosanna-Tabor. Her
title is apparently secular.
However, as the majority recognizes, a title is
merely an expression of how an employer holds its em-
ployee out to the community. Part of St. James's ex-
pression of Biel's role in the school is her designation
as a "Catholic school educatorH" in the school's Code of
Ethics. The Code conveyed to the community that
Catholic school educators such as Biel would, among
27a
other things, "[p]romote the peace of Christ in the
world." Biel's title is presumably both "Catholic school
educator[" and "Grade 5 Teacher," the former contex-
tualizing the latter. St. James thus holds Biel out as a
distinctively Catholic Grade 5 Teacher.
This first factor could therefore indicate that Biel
was a minister. In fact, some of the "called" language
that was important to determining that the teacher in
Hosanna-Tabor was a minister is also present in the
faculty handbook in this case. For instance, in the
Code of Ethics, under "Commitment to the Commu-
nity," the handbook reads "As Catholic school educa-
tors, we are called to ... [p]romote the peace of Christ
in the world." (emphasis added).
Although it seems strained to read Biel's title as
"Grade 5 Teacher" without considering references in
the handbook to St. James's teachers as "Catholic
school educators," such a reading may be appropriate
at this stage in order to draw reasonable inferences in
Biel's favor. Therefore, in the Hosanna-Tabor analy-
sis, I consider Biel's title to be secular. This factor
therefore weighs against recognizing her as a minis-
ter. However, her title is not dispositive. Id. at 193
("[A] title, by itself, does not automatically ensure cov-
erage."); id. at 202 (Alito, J., concurring) (a ministerial
title is "neither necessary nor sufficient.").
ii. Substance reflected in the title
In Hosanna-Tabor, this factor weighed in favor of
applying the exception. The called teacher's title of
"commissioned minister" reflected "a significant de-
gree of religious training," including college-level the-
ology, "followed by a formal process of commissioning."
28a
Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 191. In contrast, Biel re-
ceived no religious commissioning and her formal ed-
ucation consisted of a university degree in liberal stud-
ies and a teaching certification. She was not required
to be endorsed by the parish or to go through extensive
training.
The majority focuses narrowly on educational and
practical training for the second factor in the Ho-
sanna-Tabor analysis. However, I do not understand
this second factor to be limited to education and prac-
tical training. The substance reflected in a title is
broader than mere educational or practical prerequi-
sites. See Grussgott, 882 F.3d at 659-660. Considering
other elements under the second factor facilitates the
ministerial exception's application to different reli-
gions, including those that may not require formal
training for ministers. It also complements Justice
Thomas's emphasis on the religious organization's
own sincere determination of who ministers the faith.
Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 196-97 (Thomas, J., con-
curring). If we expected all ministers to receive formal
religious education, we would improperly restrict the
exception.
Instead, I conclude that the substance underlying
Biel's title at St. James consists of the school's expec-
tation, to which Biel specifically consented in her em-
ployment contract, that she propagate and manifest
the Catholic faith in all aspects of the role. Im-
portantly, the substance of Biel's title of Grade 5
Teacher encompassed the role of religion teacher.
The approach of analyzing the second factor as re-
flective of how the religious organization understood
an employee's role is also consistent with at least two
of our sister Circuits' interpretations. In Fratello, the
29a
Second Circuit ultimately concluded that a "lay prin-
cipal" of a Catholic elementary school was a minister.
863 F.3d at 206, 210. In evaluating this title, the court
observed that though the principal was "not strictly re-
quired to meet any formal religious-education require-
ments, the substance reflected in that title as used by
the defendants and conveyed to the plaintiff entails
proficiency in religious leadership." Id. at 208. Simi-
larly, the Seventh Circuit in Grussgott held that the
second factor weighed in favor of applying the excep-
tion to a Hebrew language teacher at a Jewish school,
not only because of her religious training, but also be-
cause "the substance of [the teacher's] title as con-
veyed to her and as perceived by others entails the
teaching of the Jewish religion to students." 882 F.3d
at 659-60.
The majority distinguishes Grussgott based on the
teacher's Tal Am certification, but in Grussgott, the
Seventh Circuit specifically noted that there was noth-
ing in the record indicating what the Tal Am certifica-
tion entailed beyond completion of seminars. Id. at
659. Though the Seventh Circuit found that the
teacher's Tal Am certification was not material to its
analysis, the court nevertheless held that the teacher's
curriculum and experience teaching religion "sup-
port[ed] the application of the ministerial exception"
at the second factor. Id. at 660. Contrary to the major-
ity's conclusion, this case is not distinguishable from
Grussgott based on a certification that may or may not
have indicated any significant degree of education or
training. The Seventh Circuit's consideration of curric-
ulum and teaching experience under the second Ho-
sanna-Tabor factor supports the conclusion that this
factor encompasses more than just training.
30a
Even more explicitly than in Grussgott, the sub-
stance of Biel's title as the Grade 5 Teacher encom-
passes her responsibility for all facets of her pupils' ed-
ucation, which unquestionably includes religion class
and imparting the substantive teachings of the Cath-
olic faith. In addition to her role as the religion
teacher, Biel agreed in her contract that she "under-
stood that the mission of the School [was] to develop
and promote a Catholic School Faith Community
within the philosophy of Catholic education as imple-
mented at the School, and the doctrines, laws and
norms of the Catholic Church." The faculty handbook
extensively prescribes how the faculty should model
the Catholic faith and promote religious development.
Additionally, Biel was required to attend a Catholic
education conference, which focused on incorporating
religion into lesson plans. Finally, her contract was ap-
proved by both St. James's principal, Sister Mary Mar-
garet, and the pastor of the parish, and it clarified that
her role as a fifth grade teacher included teaching re-
ligion, specifically the Catholic faith. Because all of
these expectations were included in Biel's role and in
the title given to her by St. James, I conclude that her
title reflected significant religious substance. This fac-
tor therefore weighs in favor of applying the exception.
iii. Biel's own use of the title
"[A]n employee who holds herself out as a religious
leader is more likely to be considered a minister." Pui,
844 F.3d at 1160. In Hosanna-Tabor, the teacher "held
herself out as a minister of the Church" in several
ways, including "accepting the formal call to religious
service," "claim [ing] a special housing allowance on
her taxes" available only to ministers, and indicating,
31a
post-termination, "that she regarded herself as a min-
ister at Hosanna-Tabor." 565 U.S. at 191-92. Here, alt-
hough Biel taught her students the tenets of the Cath-
olic faith, she did not present herself to the public as a
minister. See Conlon, 777 F.3d at 835 (concluding that
this factor was not present when the employee did not
have a "public role of interacting with the community
as an ambassador of the faith"). This factor therefore
weighs against concluding that Biel was a minister.
iv. Important religious functions performed
In Puri, this Court emphasized that employees who
have "a role in conveying the Church's message and
carrying out its mission" are likely ministers "even if
[they] devote[] only a small portion of the workday to
strictly religious duties." Puri, 844 F.3d at 1160 (inter-
nal citation and alterations omitted). In Hosanna-Ta-
bor, the teacher was responsible for "'leading others
toward Christian maturity' and 'teaching faithfully
the Word of God, the Sacred Scriptures, in its truth
and purity and as set forth in all the symbolical books
of the Evangelical Lutheran Church."' 565 U.S. at 192
(alterations omitted) (quoting the record). The Ho-
sanna-Tabor teacher taught religion four days a week,
led her students in prayer three times a day, took stu-
dents to school-wide chapel services once a week, and
led that chapel service approximately twice a year. Id.
Based on those duties, the Supreme Court concluded
that "[a]s a source of religious instruction, [the
teacher] performed an important role in transmitting
the Lutheran faith to the next generation." Id. The
Court indicated that it would be error to give too much
weight to secular duties performed in addition to reli-
32a
gious ones or to the fact that "others not formally rec-
ognized as ministers .. .perform the same functions."
Id. at 193.
Biel's duties as the fifth grade teacher and religion
teacher are strikingly similar to those in Hosanna-Ta-
bor. She taught religion class four times a week based
on the catechetical textbook Coming to God's Life. In
that class, she was responsible for instructing her stu-
dents on various areas of Catholic teachings, including
Catholic sacraments, Catholic Saints, Catholic social
teaching, and Catholic doctrine related to the Eucha-
rist and the season of Lent. She prayed Catholic pray-
ers with her students twice each day and attended
monthly school mass with her class.3 Additionally,
she, like all teachers at St. James, was evaluated on
incorporating "signs, sacramental [sic], [and] tradi-
tions of the Roman Catholic Church in the Classroom"
and "infus[ing] [Catholic values] through all subject
areas." "As a source of religious instruction, [she] per-
formed an important role in transmitting the [Catho-
lic] faith to the next generation." Id. at 192. For these
reasons, this factor weighs heavily in favor of consid-
ering Biel to be a minister. Biel was "expected to
' The majority interprets Bi's testimony to be that she joined
her students in prayer, but did not lead the fifth graders in
prayer. However, the record indicate' that Biel's prayer leaders
led the class in prayer: "I had prayer leaders. The pryers that
were aid in the classroom were said most ly by the t udent s. We
had prayer leaders." The faculty handbook set the expectation
tat htBiel would "p]rovide] opport unit ies for developing personal
prayer and shared prayer in the classroom." Under "Daily
Prayer" in the "Staff Guidelines and Respons ibilities" section of
the faculty handbook, there is a school-wide policy of beginning
and ending the day with prayer. To acept Bid's tes timony that
she merely joined the fifh gr ders in t1e ir prayer: minimizs sig-
nificant portions of the record.
33a
model, teach, and promote behavior in conformity to
the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church" according
to her employment contract, and was subject to termi-
nation if she failed to meet that expectation.
This analysis comports with the approach of the
Seventh Circuit which held that a Hebrew language
teacher "performed 'important religious functions' for
the school" when she "taught her students about Jew-
ish holidays, prayer, and the weekly Torah read-
ings ... [and] practiced the religion alongside her stu-
dents by praying with them and performing certain
rituals." Grussgott, 882 F.3d at 660 (quoting Hosanna-
Tabor, 565 U.S. at 192). The duties of the teacher in
Grussgott are found in Biel's case as well. My conclu-
sion on this factor is also consistent with the Sixth Cir-
cuit's approach in Conlon, which ruled that job duties
such as "assist[ing] others to cultivate 'intimacy with
God and growth in Christ-like character through per-
sonal and corporate spiritual disciplines"' constituted
important religious functions. 777 F.3d at 835.
It is clear that Biel's job duties "reflected a role in
conveying the Church's message and carrying out its
mission." Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 192. However,
Biel argues that whatever her duties were, she exe-
cuted them in a decidedly secular manner. She claims
that her religious instruction was straight out of a
textbook-just like with secular classes and that her
only job at mass was "to make sure the kids were quiet
and in their seats." Appellant's Br. at 47. Her claim
that she executed her duties in a secular manner di-
rectly conflicts with her contractual agreement to "in-
tegrate Catholic thought" into subjects, "celebrate reg-
ularly scheduled Masses ...with students," and "en-
courage student participation in liturgical services." In
34a
fact, under "Staff Guidelines and Responsibilities" in
the handbook, teachers are specifically expected to do
more than merely keep their elementary students
quiet during mass-they are expected to prepare their
students for mass: "Teachers prepare their students to
be active participants at Mass, with particular empha-
sis on Mass responses." Biel indicated that her stu-
dents participated in mass by presenting the gifts, i.e.,
the Eucharist. Biel's students were trained to present
the gifts, and Biel was available to review the practice
with them if necessary. Biel's role at mass was also to
personally demonstrate her faith through active par-
ticipation in "worship-centered school events." Biel's
role as an "exemplar[] of practicing" Catholics would
not make her a minister if that were her only religious
function. See E.E.O.C. v. Miss. College, 626 F.2d 477,
485 (5th Cir. 1980). But because the determination of
who is a minister is a totality of the circumstances test,
I consider "all the circumstances of her employment"
in the assessment of her role. Hosanna-Tabor, 565
U.S. at 190.
Biel's argument that she performed her duties in a
secular manner invites the very analysis the ministe-
rial exception demands we avoid. The courts may not
evaluate the relative importance of a ministerial duty
to a religion's overall mission or belief system. The
very duties that Biel attempts to trivialize, e.g. teach-
ing Church doctrine and requiring participation and
attentiveness during mass, could easily be considered
essential to the faith and its conveyance to the next
generation, and she very well could have been termi-
nated for failures in this area.
Consideration of her claims in federal court would
require the evaluation of "the importance and priority
35a
of the religious doctrine in question, with a civil fact-
finder sitting in ultimate judgment of what the ac-
cused church really believes, and how important that
belief is to the church's overall mission." Hosanna-Ta-
bor, 565 U.S. at 206 (Alito, J., concurring). We must
avoid entangling the courts in this sort of analysis. In
Alcazar, this Court cited a Seventh Circuit case that
discussed the kind of government interference in reli-
gious affairs that the ministerial exception is designed
to avoid. 627 F.3d at 1292 (citing Tomic v. Catholic Di-
ocese of Peoria, 442 F.3d 1036, 1040 (7th Cir. 2006),
abrogated by Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. 171)). The
Tomic court explained that if a suit were allowed to go
forward between a minister and a church, the church
would defend its adverse employment decision with a
religious reason. The employee would argue that the
religious reason was a farce, and the real reason was
one prohibited by statute. In response the church
would provide evidence of the religious reason, which
the employee would dispute. The court would then
have to "resolve a theological dispute" in the course of
its adjudication of the claim. Tom ic, 442 F.3d at 1040
(citing DeMarco v. Holy Cross High Sch., 4 F.3d 166,
171 (2d Cir. 1993)). The Religion Clauses do not permit
such entanglement in the affairs of religious organiza-
tions.
The Seventh Circuit rejected a similar argument in
Grussgott when the Hebrew teacher attempted to por-
tray her role as teaching from a "culturally" Jewish
perspective rather than a religious perspective. For ex-
ample, the teacher attempted to distinguish between
"leading prayer, as opposed to 'teaching' and 'practic-
ing' prayer with her students." 882 F.3d at 660. Her
argument did not prevail because a teacher's "opinion
36a
does not dictate what activities the school may genu-
inely consider to be religious." Id. Similarly here, how
Biel subjectively approached her duties is not rele-
vant, let alone determinative.
C. Consideration of all the circumstances
Because the Supreme Court refused "to adopt a
rigid formula," this Court should not treat the four Ho-
sanna-Tabor factors as a strict test. Hosanna-Tabor,
565 U.S. at 190. Instead, the Court should take a step
back and consider whether "all the circumstances of
[Biel's] employment" require that her claims be barred
by the ministerial exception. Id.
In reconciling the four factors with the totality of
the circumstances approach, the Seventh Circuit rea-
soned that where two factors weighed in favor of the
exception and two weighed against, "it would be overly
formalistic" to simply "call [the] case a draw."
Grussgott, 882 F.3d at 661.4 I agree. See also Conlon,
777 F.3d at 835 (applying ministerial exception when
two factors were present); Cannata v. Catholic Diocese
of Austin, 700 F.3d 169, 177 (5th Cir. 2012) ("Applica-
tion of the exception ... does not depend on a finding
that [the employee] satisfies" the four factors.). The
Seventh Circuit in Grussgott ultimately applied the
ministerial exception because "[t]he school intended
[the teacher] to take on a religious role, and in fact her
job entailed many functions that simply would not be
part of a secular teacher's job." 882 F.3d at 661. The
court held that "it [was] fair to say that, under the to-
tality of the circumstances in this particular case, the
' The Seventh Circuit described the Hebrew tea nher's ttle and
whether she held her elf out as a minister as "'formalitic fac-
tors... great ly outweighedl by [her] dut ies and funct ions."
37a
importance of [the teacher's] role as a 'teacher of faith'
to the next generation outweighed other considera-
tions." Id. (alteration omitted) (quoting Hosanna-Ta-
bor, 565 U.S. at 199 (Alito, J., concurring)). So too here.
In considering the complete picture of Biel's em-
ployment, I am struck by the importance of her stew-
ardship of the Catholic faith to the children in her
class. Biel's Grade 5 Teacher title may not have explic-
itly announced her role in ministry, but the substance
reflected in her title demonstrates that she was a
Catholic school educator with a distinctly religious
purpose. The religious purpose of Catholic school edu-
cators is not new to the federal courts. The Supreme
Court has long "recognized the critical and unique role
of the teacher in fulfilling the mission of a church-op-
erated school." Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S. at 501 (dis-
cussing Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 617 (1971)).
Biel expressly acknowledged this purpose in her con-
tract, and committed herself to performing all "duties
and responsibilities ...within [the] overriding com-
mitment" of St. James to "develop and promote a Cath-
olic School Faith Community within the philosophy of
Catholic education." Biel acknowledged that her con-
tinued employment was dependent upon her demon-
strated ability to do so. Drawing all inferences in Biel's
favor, it is still impossible to ignore that her position
at St. James was pervaded by religious purpose.
Looking at each of the Hosanna-Tabor factors, and
considering the evidence in its totality without adher-
ence to a formulaic calculation, it appears that Biel
was a minister, though perhaps not as obviously as the
teacher in Hosanna-Tabor. However, the teacher in
Hosanna-Tabor was within the Protestant Christian
38a
framework, and therefore the terminology of her em-
ployment very neatly fit within the ministerial excep-
tion. We must not make the mistake of tethering the
exception too close to the Protestant Christian concept
of ministers. See Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 198
(Alito, J., concurring).
The ministerial exception protects the relationship
between a church and its ministers. It does not require
a church to assert a religious reason for an employ-
ment decision. I fear that the majority's opinion will
undermine this protection. The majority holds that
"had St. James asserted a religious justification for
terminating Biel, our holding would neither have com-
manded nor permitted the district court to assess the
religious validity of that explanation, but rather only
whether the proffered justification was the actual mo-
tivation for termination." Maj. Op. at 2 n.6. But the
majority misses the point of the ministerial exception,
which is to shield the relationship between a church
and its ministers from the eyes of the court without
requiring the church to provide a religious justification
for an adverse employment decision. Hosanna-Tabor,
565 U.S. at 194-95 ("The purpose of the exception is
not to safeguard a church's decision to fire a minister
only when it is made for a religious reason. The excep-
tion instead ensures that the authority to select and
control who will minister to the faithful... is the
church's alone.").
This case demonstrates that the First Amend-
ment's guarantees are not without cost. The ADA pro-
tects some of the most vulnerable people in our society
from discrimination. It is an incredibly important stat-
utory protection. But "[t]he First Amendment, of
39a
course, is a limitation on the power of Congress," and
any exercise of statutory rights under the ADA re-
quires the courts "to decide whether that [is] constitu-
tionally permissible under the Religion Clauses of the
First Amendment." Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S. at 499.
We are necessarily bound by the Supreme Court's
adoption of the ministerial exception, and its guaran-
tee of noninterference in religious self-governance. If
the exception is to provide sufficient protection for re-
ligious freedom, courts must give the exception a broad
application. Puri, 844 F.3d at 1159.
In light of these considerations, Hosanna-Tabor,
and all the circumstances of this case, I would con-
clude that the ministerial exception does apply to Biel
in her capacity as the fifth grade teacher at St. James
because of the substance reflected in her title and the
important religious functions she performed. These
factors outweigh her formal title and whether she held
herself out as a minister. Ultimately, Biel was "en-
trusted with teaching and conveying the tenets of the
faith to the next generation." Hosanna-Tabor, 565
U.S. at 200 (Alito, J., concurring). Those responsibili-
ties render her the "type of employee that a church
must be free to appoint or dismiss in order to exercise
the religious liberty that the First Amendment guar-
antees." Id. at 206.
III
For the above reasons, I respectfully dissent. I
would affirm the ruling of the District Court.

SUMMARY**
Employment Discrimination
The panel denied a petition for panel rehearing
and, on behalf of the court, a petition for rehearing en
banc following the panel's opinion reversing the dis-
trict court's summary judgment in an employment
discrimination action under the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act.
In its opinion, the panel held that the First
Amendment's ministerial exception to generally ap-
plicable employment laws did not bar a teacher's
claim against the Catholic elementary school that
terminated her employment.
Dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc,
Judge R. Nelson, joined by Judges Bybee, Callahan,
Bea, M. Smith, Ikuta, Bennett, Bade, and Collins,
wrote that the panel's opinion embraced the narrow-
est construction of the ministerial exception, split
from the consensus of other circuits that the employ-
ee's ministerial function should be the key focus, and
conflicted with the Supreme Court's decision in Ho-
sanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v.
E.E.O.C., 565 U.S. 171 (2012).
ORDER
The panel has voted unanimously to deny the peti-
tion for panel rehearing. Judge Fisher recommends
granting the petition for rehearing en banc.

The full court has been advised of the petition for
rehearing en banc. A judge of the court requested a
vote on en bane rehearing. The matter failed to re-
ceive a majority of votes of non-recused active judges
in favor of en banc consideration. Fed. R. App.
P. 35(f).
The petition for rehearing and the petition for re-
hearing en banc are DENIED.
R. NELSON, Circuit Judge, with whom BYBEE,
CALLAHAN, BEA, M. SMITH, IKUTA, BENNETT,
BADE, and COLLINS, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting
from the denial of rehearing en banc:
By declining to rehear this case en banc, our court
embraces the narrowest construction of the First
Amendment's "ministerial exception" and splits from
the consensus of our sister circuits that the employ-
ee's ministerial function should be the key focus. The
panel majority held that Kristen Biel, a fifth-grade
teacher who taught religion and other classes at a
Catholic school, was not a "minister" because the cir-
cumstances of her employment were not a carbon
copy of the plaintiff's circumstances in Hosanna-
Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v.
E.E.O.C., 565 U.S. 171, 196 (2012). See Biel v. St.
James Sch., 911 F.3d 603 (9th Cir. 2018). The panel
majority's approach conflicts with Hosanna-Tabor,
decisions from our court and sister courts, decisions
from state supreme courts, and First Amendment
principles. And it poses grave consequences for reli-
gious minorities (collectively, a substantial plurality
of religious adherents in this circuit) whose practices
43a
don't perfectly resemble the Lutheran tradition at is-
sue in Hosanna-Tabor.
This is precisely the case warranting en banc re-
view. We adopted the ministerial exception en banc
prior to Hosanna-Tabor. See Alcazar v. Corp. of the
Catholic Archbishop of Seattle, 627 F.3d 1288 (9th
Cir. 2010) (en banc). The ministerial exception "is
undeniably an issue of exceptional importance" be-
cause its denial "portends serious consequences for
one of the bedrock principles of our country's for-
mation-religious freedom." Bollard v. Cal. Province
of the Soc'y of Jesus, 211 F.3d 1331, 1333 (9th Cir.
2000) (Wardlaw, J., joined by Kozinski, O'Scannlain,
and Kleinfeld, JJ., dissenting from denial of rehear-
ing en banc).
Since then, the Supreme Court unanimously up-
held the ministerial exception in Hosanna-Tabor,
suggesting its application in a case like this. Three
Justices-Thomas, Alito, and Kagan-filed or joined
two separate concurrences specifically proposing legal
tests under which the ministerial exception plainly
applies here (and no Justice has proposed a test un-
dermining its application here). And virtually all our
sister courts-and state supreme courts-adopted the
ministerial exception in similar cases.
In this case, five different amici-coalitions of re-
ligiously diverse organizations and law professors
urge this court to correct its legal error. As amici ex-
plain, the panel majority's approach trivializes the
significant religious function performed by Catholic
school teachers. This court's narrow construction of
the exception threatens the autonomy of minority re-
ligious groups, like amici, "for whom religious educa-
tion is a critical means of propagating the faith, in-
44a
structing the rising generation, and instilling a
sense of religious identity." Brief of Gen. Conference
of Seventh-Day Adventists, Int'l Soc. for Krishna
Consciousness, Inc., Jewish Coalition for Religious
Liberty, and Shaykh Hamza Yusuf as Amici Curiae
in Support of Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc at 2.
In light of all this, where does our court now stand
on the ministerial exception? Despite a unanimous
Supreme Court opinion upholding the exception, we
are weaker, not stronger, in applying it. Not once, not
twice, but three times now in the last two years, we
have departed from the plain direction of the Su-
preme Court and reversed our district courts' faithful
application of Supreme Court precedent. See also Puri
v. Khalsa, 844 F.3d 1152 (9th Cir. 2017); Morrissey-
Berru v. Our Lady of Guadalupe Sch., No. 17-56624,
2019 WL 1952853 (9th Cir. Apr. 30, 2019) (un-
published). And in each successive case, we have ex-
cised the ministerial exception, slicing through con-
stitutional muscle and now cutting deep into core
constitutional bone.
In turning a blind eye to St. James's religious lib-
erties protected by both Religion Clauses, we exhibit
the very hostility toward religion our Founders pro-
hibited and the Supreme Court has repeatedly in-
structed us to avoid. Accordingly, I dissent.
I
The ministerial exception is well-entrenched in
our constitutional framework. "The Supreme Court
has long recognized religious organizations' broad
right to control the selection of their own religious
leaders." Puri, 844 F.3d at 1157. In 2012, a unani-
mous Supreme Court formally recognized a "ministe-
45a
rial exception" "grounded in the First Amendment[]
that precludes application of [employment-
discrimination] legislation to claims concerning the
employment relationship between a religious institu-
tion and its ministers." Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at
188. In doing so, the Court reaffirmed "that it is im-
permissible for the government to contradict a
church's determination of who can act as its minis-
ters." Id. at 185.
A
I begin with the text. "Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibit-
ing the free exercise thereof ...." U.S. Cost. amend.
I. The Establishment Clause and Free Exercise
Clause have been said to "often exert conflicting
pressures," Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 719
(2005), but they speak in harmony to ensure dual
protections for religious freedom.
A troubled history of religious persecution led a
young United States to break from the familiarities of
living under the established Church of England. See
Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 182-83 ("Seeking to es-
cape the control of the national church, the Puritans
fled to New England, where they hoped to elect their
own ministers and establish their own modes of wor-
ship." (citations omitted)). Creating a Federal Gov-
ernment with powers "few and defined," see The Fed-
eralist No. 45 (James Madison), the Founders con-
firmed that the new government, unlike the English
Crown, would have no role in filling ecclesiastical of-
fices. See Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 184.
To avoid entangling government and religion, our
government is prohibited from deciding matters in-
46a
herently ecclesiastical. See Watson v. Jones, 80 U.S.
(13 Wall.) 679, 730-31 (1872). While the Establish-
ment Clause expressly limits the government's pow-
er, the Free Exercise Clause also affirmatively pro-
tects religious institutions, which are "independen[t]
from secular control or manipulation," as they have
the "power to decide for themselves, free from state
interference, matters of church government as well
as those of faith and doctrine." Kedroff v. Saint Nich-
olas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in N.
Am., 344 U.S. 94, 116 (1952). This includes the
"[f]reedom to select the clergy." Id. By interfering
with a religious institution's freedom to select those
church personnel who promote its faith and mission,
the government exceeds its delegated authority and
infringes on that institution's right to free exercise of
religion.
The Founders understood these First Amendment
protections were so fundamental that enshrining
them in the Constitution outweighed the ancillary
costs. These costs, in some cases, are not insignifi-
cant. They include exemptions for religious organiza-
tions from some laws protecting society's most vul-
nerable from employment discrimination. See Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e
et seq. For example, after the Salvation Army termi-
nated one of its ministers, the employee sued, alleg-
ing a violation of Title VII. See McClure v. Salvation
Army, 460 F.2d 553 (5th Cir. 1972). The Fifth Circuit
held the First Amendment barred the Title VII claim,
reasoning that "[m]atters touching" "[t]he relation-
ship between an organized church and its minis-
ters ... must necessarily be recognized as of prime
ecclesiastical concern" because a church's "minister is
the chief instrument by which [it] seeks to fulfill its
47a
purpose." Id. at 558-59. In the decades since, every
Circuit to address the issue, including this one,'
unanimously recognized this "ministerial exception."
B
In Hosanna-Tabor, the Supreme Court followed
the uniform approach of the Courts of Appeals and
held the ministerial exception bars employment dis-
crimination suits by the group's ministers. 565 U.S. at
190. The case involved an employment discrimination
claim brought by Cheryl Perich, a former elementary
teacher, against her employer, Hosanna-Tabor Evan-
gelical Lutheran Church and School. Id. at 177-79.
Perich was first employed as a "lay teacher" and later
became a "called teacher." Id. at 178. She taught kin-
dergarten for four years and fourth grade for one
year, which involved teaching a variety of subjects,
including religion. Id. Specifically, Perich "taught a
religion class four days a week, led the students in
prayer and devotional exercises each day, and at-
tended a weekly school-wide chapel service. [She] led
the chapel service herself about twice a year." Id. Af-
ter Perich was diagnosed with narcolepsy and termi-
nated, the EEOC sued the school, and Perich inter-
vened, alleging violations of the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act ("ADA"), 104 Stat. 327, 42 U.S.C.
§ 12101 et seq. (1990). Id. at 180.
The Court held the ministerial exception "ensures
that the authority to select and control who will min-
ister to the faithful a matter 'strictly ecclesiasti-
cal'-is the church's alone." Id. at 194-95 (internal
1 See Werft v. Dwtr Sir. Annua i conference, :77 F.: d 1099,
1101-04 (9th Cir. 2004).
48a
citation omitted) (quoting Kedroff, 344 U.S. at 119).
The Court explained:
Requiring a church to accept or retain an un-
wanted minister, or punishing a church for
failing to do so, intrudes upon more than a
mere employment decision. Such action inter-
feres with the internal governance of the
church, depriving the church of control over the
selection of those who will personify its beliefs.
By imposing an unwanted minister, the state
infringes the Free Exercise Clause, which pro-
tects a religious group's right to shape its own
faith and mission through its appointments.
According the state the power to determine
which individuals will minister to the faithful
also violates the Establishment Clause, which
prohibits government involvement in such ec-
clesiastical decisions.
Id. at 188-89.
The Court unanimously held the ministerial ex-
ception barred Perich's suit. Although Perich was an
elementary school teacher, the Court agreed with eve-
ry Court of Appeals to have considered the question
that the "exception is not limited to the head of a re-
ligious congregation." Id. at 190. However, the Court
was "reluctant ... to adopt a rigid formula for decid-
ing when an employee qualifies as a minister." Id. In-
stead, it found that "all the circumstances of
[Perich's] employment," supported "that the excep-
tion covers Perich." Id.
The Court discussed four "considerations" which
supported its conclusion that Perich fell within the
exception's scope: "the formal title given Perich by
49a
the Church, the substance reflected in that title, her
own use of that title, and the important religious
functions she performed for the Church." Id. at 192.
Each of these separate considerations evidenced
Perich's ministerial role, including that her "job du-
ties reflected a role in conveying the Church's mes-
sage and carrying out its mission." Id. at 192. Thus,
"the interest of religious groups in choosing who will
preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out
their mission" warranted application of the exception
to Perich. Id. at 196.
While each of the four considerations confirmed
Perich was a minister, the Court's discussion of them
did not create a test for courts to use to decide wheth-
er an employee was a "minister" under the exception.
The Court specifically reserved the ministerial excep-
tion's legal floor: "We express no view on whether
someone with Perich's duties would be covered by the
ministerial exception in the absence of the other con-
siderations we have discussed." Id. at 193 (emphasis
added).
Justice Alito, joined by Justice Kagan, however,
did express a view on this issue: "[C]ourts should fo-
cus on the function performed by persons who work
for religious bodies." Id. at 198 (Alito, J., concurring)
(emphasis added).2 This "functional consensus" was
widespread before Hosanna-Tabor and has remained
dominant afterward., As such, nothing in the opinion
2 Justice Thomas went further, noting the Religion Claues re-
quire court "to defer to a religious organization's good-faith un-
dersanding of who qualifies as its minister." /d. at 1) (Thom-
as, J., concurring).
3 See Holllit v. Me/hodis[ //e/lhcur, Inc., 474 F.:3d 22:, 226
(6th ir. 2007) (referring to func tion as the "general rule"), ab-
50a
"should.... be read to upset [the] consensus" among
Courts of Appeals (including our own4) that took this
"functional approach." Id. at 204. The concurrence
also cautioned it would be a mistake, given the coun-
try's religious diversity, "if the term 'minister' or
the concept of ordination were viewed as central to
the important issue of religious autonomy that is pre-
sented in cases like this one." Id. at 198.
II
The panel majority mistakes Hosanna-Tabor to
create a resemblance-to-Perich test using the "four
considerations" which the Supreme Court found evi-
denced Perich's ministerial role. Because Biel's cir-
cumstances resembled Perich's in only one of the four
areas, the panel majority held erroneously that the
exception did not apply.
Biel taught fifth grade at St. James Catholic
School in Torrance. Biel, 911 F.3d at 605. She was
responsible for teaching her students all academic
subjects and religion, to which she was required to
dedicate a minimum of 200 minutes each week. Biel
v. St. James Sch., No. 15-04248, 2017 WL 5973293,
at *1 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 24, 2017). She taught religion at
least four days per week, using a curriculum and
textbook grounded in the Catholic Faith and in ac-
cordance with the Church's teaching. Biel, 911 F.3d
at 605. Biel also supervised and joined her students

during twice-daily prayer led by students and escort-
ed them to a school-wide monthly mass. Id.
Biel's signed employment contract required her to
work toward St. James's "overriding commitment" to
the "doctrines, laws, and norms" of the Catholic
Church, and to "model, teach, and promote behavior
in conformity to the teaching of the Roman Catholic
Church." Id. It also stated the school's mission: "to
develop and promote a Catholic School Faith Com-
munity within the philosophy of Catholic education
as implemented at [St. James], and the doctrines,
laws, and norms of the Catholic Church." Id. at 612
(Fisher, J., dissenting). The school's faculty handbook
further required that teachers "participate in the
Church's mission" of providing "quality Catholic edu-
cation to ... students, educating them in academic
areas and in ... Catholic faith and values." Id. at
605-06 (majority op.).
At Biel's only formal teaching evaluation, the
school's principal, Sister Mary Margaret, measured
Biel's performance in both secular and religious as-
pects. Id. at 606. The evaluation was positive, though
noting areas for improvement. Id. Less than six
months later, Biel learned she had breast cancer. Id.
She told the school she would miss work to undergo
surgery and chemotherapy. Id.
A few weeks later, Biel was informed her teaching
contract would not be renewed for the next academic
year. Id. Biel sued St. James, alleging her termina-
tion violated the ADA. The district court determined
the ministerial exception applied and granted sum-
mary judgment in favor of St. James. Biel, 2017 WL
5973293, at *3.
52a
Our court reversed in a 2-1 decision. Biel, 911
F.3d 603. The panel majority compared Biel's circum-
stances with Perich's under each of the four "consid-
erations," but concluded the only similarity between
Biel and Perich was that "they both taught religion in
the classroom." Id. at 609. Contrasting Biel and
Perich, the majority determined Biel had "none of
Perich's credentials, training, or ministerial back-
ground," St. James did not "hold Biel out as a minis-
ter by suggesting to its community that she has spe-
cial expertise in Church doctrine, values, or pedagogy
beyond that of any practicing Catholic," id. at 608,
and "nothing in the record indicates that Biel consid-
ered herself a minister or presented herself as one to
the community," id. at 609.
Because, "[a]t most, only one of the four Hosanna-
Tabor considerations weigh[ed] in St. James's favor,"
the panel majority held the ministerial exception did
not apply. Id. at 610. The majority refused "to exempt
from federal employment law all those who intermin-
gle religious and secular duties but who do not
'preach [their employers'] beliefs, teach their
faith, ... carry out their mission ... [and] guide [their
religious organization] on its way."' Id. at 611 (quot-
ing Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 196). The panel ma-
jority "decline[d] St. James's invitation to be the first"
federal court of appeals to apply "the ministerial ex-
ception in a case that bears so little resemblance to
Hosanna-Tabor." Id. at 610.
III
When considering the "totality of the circumstanc-
es," the panel majority converted the four considera-
tions discussed by the Supreme Court into a compar-
ative test: "Only after describing all of these aspects
53a
of Perich's position did the Supreme Court hold ...
that Perich was a minister covered by the ministerial
exception." Id. at 608 (emphasis added) (internal quo-
tation marks omitted). Under the panel majority's
test, a religious organization must show that its em-
ployee served a significant religious function and the
presence of at least one additional "consideration" to
receive protection under the ministerial exception.
But Hosanna-Tabor mandates no such require-
ment. It did not establish a test or set any legal floor
that must be met for the exception to apply. It held
only that the exception exists, applies to ADA claims,
and covered Perich. Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 190.
The panel majority embraced the narrowest reading
of the ministerial exception and diverged from the
function-focused approach taken by our court previ-
ously, our sister courts, and numerous state supreme
courts.
As our court recently observed, "The Supreme
Court has provided some guidance on the circum-
stances that might qualify an employee as a minister
within the meaning of the ministerial exception." Pu-
ri, 844 F.3d at 1160 (emphasis added). Other circuits
agree. See Grussgott v. Milwaukee Jewish Day Sch.,
Inc., 882 F.3d 655, 658 (7th Cir. 2018), cert. denied,
139 S. Ct. 456 (2018) ("Consequently, Grussgott's ar-
gument focuses on differentiating herself from the
teacher in that case, and she is correct that her role
is distinct from the called teacher's in Hosanna-Tabor.
But the Supreme Court expressly declined to deline-
ate a 'rigid formula' for deciding when an employee is
a minister." (citing Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 190));
Fratello v. Archdiocese of N.Y., 863 F.3d 190, 204-05
(2d Cir. 2017) ("Hosanna-Tabor instructs only as to
54a
what we might take into account as relevant, includ-
ing the four considerations on which it relied; it nei-
ther limits the inquiry to those considerations nor re-
quires their application in every case."); Cannata v.
Catholic Diocese of Austin, 700 F.3d 169, 176-77 (5th
Cir. 2012) ("Any attempt to calcify the particular con-
siderations that motivated the Court in Hosanna-
Tabor into a 'rigid formula' would not be appropri-
ate .... Application of the exception... does not de-
pend on a finding that [the employee] satisfies the
same considerations that motivated the Court to find
that Perich was a minister within the meaning of the
exception.").
Ignoring the warnings of Justices Alito and Kagan
(and Justice Thomas), the panel majority found that
because three of the considerations all of which re-
late to Biel's title-were not present, the exception
did not apply. See Biel, 911 F.3d at 607-09. The only
area in which it did find Biel and Perich similar was
in the religious function each performed. Yet this
similarity is particularly significant to religious
groups whose beliefs and practices may render the
other three considerations less relevant, or not rele-
vant at all. Such is the case here.
Comparing Biel's title to Perich's, the panel ma-
jority reasoned, "it cannot be said that [Biel's title of]
Grade 5 Teacher 'conveys a religious as opposed to
secular- meaning."' Biel, 911 F.3d at 608-09 (quot-
ing Conlon v. Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship, 777
F.3d 829, 834-35 (6th Cir. 2015)). Unlike in Biel,
Perich's title in Hosanna-Tabor was particularly rel-
evant because, as the Court noted, the Sixth Circuit
"failed to see any relevance in the fact that Perich
was a commissioned minister." Hosanna-Tabor, 565
55a
U.S. at 192-93. Clarifying that her title "by itself,
does not automatically ensure coverage," the Court
explained that "the fact that an employee has been
ordained or commissioned as a minister is surely rel-
evant." Id. at 193. In this discussion, the Court did
not suggest that the lack of a title with religious sig-
nificance suggests that an employee does not hold a
ministerial role. See Fratello, 863 F.3d at 207 ("Nor
would plainly secular titles (by themselves) prevent
application of the ministerial exception. We think the
substance of the employees' responsibilities in their
positions is far more important."). Indeed, requiring a
religious group to adopt a formal title or hold out its
ministers in a specific way is the very encroachment
into religious autonomy the Free Exercise Clause
prohibits, precisely because such a demand for eccle-
siastical titles inherently violates the Establishment
Clause.
Requiring religious titles is particularly problem-
atic when religious organizations do not bestow such
titles on some (or any) of their ministers yet clearly
understand the employee's role to carry religious sig-
nificance. This is why "a recognized religious mission
[which] underlie[s] the description of the employee's
position" is also "surely relevant," just as an employ-
ee's title or ordination may be. Hosanna-Tabor, 565
U.S. at 193. Title may cut one way because "an em-
ployee is more likely to be a minister if a religious or-
ganization holds the employee out as a minister by
bestowing a formal religious title." Puri, 844 F.3d at
1160 (emphasis added). Lack of a religious title does
not suggest the opposite.
It's not surprising that Biel's title, as a Catholic
school teacher, differed from Perich's title, as a Lu-
56a
theran school teacher. "Minister," although common-
ly used in Protestant denominations, is "rarely if ever
used in this way by Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hin-
dus, or Buddhists." Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 198
(Alito, J., concurring) (emphasis added). Indeed, focus
on Biel's title "trivialized how the distinct Catholic
mission of integral formation permeated everything
Ms. Biel did as a teacher" and "downplays Ms. Biel's
function as a Catholic teacher." Brief for Nat'l Catho-
lic Educ. Ass'n as Amicus Curiae in Support of Re-
hearing and Rehearing En Banc at 4.
Catholicism contains a rich history replete with ev-
idence that its teachers play an essential role in its re-
ligious mission, yet it doesn't always embrace a formal
title for such teachers as Hosanna-Tabor did with
Perich. See generally id. at 5-9. Because of this, St.
James thoroughly explained in its Motion for Sum-
mary Judgment why the role of the teacher comes
with "duties and responsibilities" to be "performed
within the School's overriding commitment to develop-
ing its faith" by incorporating "Catholic values and
traditions throughout all subject areas, not just dur-
ing the Religion course." St. James's Mot. For Summ.
J. at 3-4, Biel v. St. James Sch., No. 15-04248, ECF
No. 65. Biel, as a teacher, played an "instrumental
role in furthering and promoting the Catholic faith as
part of her daily job duties." Id. at 13.
Nor is it surprising that a Catholic school's prac-
tices regarding ordination differ. As with title, reli-
gious training may be relevant, as it was in the Lu-
theran context. But other religious groups don't al-
ways require similar formal training yet clearly be-
stow ministerial roles. The concept of ordination-
although recognized by some, and by some only as to
57a
certain offices-"has no clear counterpart" in others.5
Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 198 (Alito, J., concur-
ring). The "Catholic Church has repeatedly empha-
sized that the growth of lay Catholic teachers those
who are succeeding roles previously held by religious
orders, sisters, brothers, and clergy- does not change
a Catholic teacher's responsibilities." Brief of Nat'l
Catholic Educ. Ass'n as Amicus Curiae in Support of
Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc at 14; see also id.
at 8-9 & n.2 ("only 2.80% of Catholic full-time profes-
sional staff are either members of the clergy or reli-
gious orders"). These diverse religious practices are
why Justices Alito and Kagan cautioned against em-
phasis on title.
Additionally, courts are ill-equipped to gauge the
religious significance of titles or the sufficiency of
training. Biel's title may appear to carry little or no
religious significance to a court unfamiliar with the
customs of Catholic education, but Biel's employment
at St. James had significant religious substance. See
Biel, 911 F.3d at 612-13, 616-18 (Fisher, J., dissent-
ing) (documents, "including her employment contract,
a performance review, and the faculty handbook," all
supported applying the exception). Thus, when not-
ing that Biel's title of "teacher" cannot be said to
convey a religious meaning, the panel majority, just
like the now-reversed Sixth Circuit in Hosanna-
Tabor, overlooks the "recognized religious mission"
I For example, Jehovah's Witnes ses considerr all" adherents to
be "ministers," while in Islam, "every Muslim can perform the
religious rites, so their is no cla s or profession of ordained clr-
gy." Homnoa-Thhor, 505 U.. at 202 nl.;3-1 (Alito, d, concur-
ring) (it nations omitted).
58a
which "underlie[s] the description of the employee's
position." Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 193.
Furthermore, ignoring this history and these
practices risks the very Establishment Clause viola-
tion the ministerial exception was intended to pre-
vent. As Justice Thomas explains:
Our country's religious landscape includes or-
ganizations with different leadership struc-
tures and doctrines that influence their con-
ceptions of ministerial status. The question
whether an employee is a minister is itself reli-
gious in nature, and the answer will vary wide-
ly. Judicial attempts to fashion a civil defini-
tion of "minister" through a bright-line test or
multi-factor analysis risk disadvantaging those
religious groups whose beliefs, practices, and
membership are outside of the "mainstream" or
unpalatable to some.
Id. at 197 (Thomas, J., concurring).
Other courts have rightly considered these differ-
ences. For example, the Massachusetts Supreme Ju-
dicial Court applied the ministerial exception to a
teacher at a Jewish school, although "she was not a
rabbi, was not called a rabbi, and did not hold herself
out as a rabbi" on a record "silent as to the extent of
her religious training." Temple Emanuel of Newton v.
Mass. Comm'n Against Discrim., 975 N.E.2d 433, 443
(Mass. 2012).
Finally, the panel majority also contrasted how
Perich held herself out as a minister, noting "nothing
in the record indicates that Biel considered herself a
minister or presented herself as one to the communi-
ty." Biel, 911 F.3d at 609. That Perich held herself out
59a
as a minister merely evidenced her ministerial role; it
did not institute a requirement that others must hold
themselves out as ministers to qualify for the excep-
tion. That is one way in which an employee is "more
likely to be considered a minister." Puri, 844 F.3d at
1160.
Biel's religious duties are far more relevant than
whether she personally felt she was a minister. See
Grussgott, 882 F.3d at 660 ("Grussgott's opinion does
not dictate what activities the school may genuinely
consider to be religious."). Presumably, any plaintiff
who wishes to avoid the application of the exception
will emphasize why she did not consider herself a
minister.
In sum, as title, training, and how an employee
holds herself out differ widely depending on tradition,
courts have rightly focused on the fourth considera-
tion-function.
IV
The panel majority rejected a function-focused ap-
proach embraced by all other circuits, including our
own, before and after Hosanna-Tabor, in favor of its
resemblance test. Despite Biel's religious function,
the panel majority refused to apply the exception be-
cause it determined the other considerations were not
present., Biel's significant religious function, as a
Catholic school teacher who teaches religion, demon-
strates why the exception applies.
6 However, Judge Fisher in dissent persuasively found two of
the considerationss" weighed in favor of the except ion. See Biel,
911 F.:kd at 616-20, 622 (concluding the ministerial exception
applied because of substance reflected in her title and important
religious functions s'he performs).
60a
A
The panel majority mistakes Hosanna-Tabor to
hold that the ministerial exception cannot apply
based on important religious functions alone, despite
the Court's express reservation of the question. See
Biel, 911 F.3d at 609 (rejecting that the exception ap-
plies based on function and "[i]f it did, most of the
analysis ... would be irrelevant dicta"); id. at 610
("the other considerations that guided the reasoning
in Hosanna-Tabor and its progeny are not present
here").
Our court should have adhered to circuit prece-
dent and followed the lead of our sister circuits by fo-
cusing on "the function performed by persons who
work for religious bodies." Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S.
at 198 (Alito, J., concurring). The majority's depar-
ture from the functional approach is even more sur-
prising because the court has previously placed more
emphasis on function post-Hosanna-Tabor.
[A]n employee whose "job duties reflect a role
in conveying the Church's message and carry-
ing out its mission" is likely to be covered by
the exception, even if the employee devotes on-
ly a small portion of the workday to strictly re-
ligious duties and spends the balance of her
time performing secular functions.
Pur, 844 F.3d at 1160 (internal brackets omitted)
(quoting Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 192). Teachers,
like Biel, at mission-driven schools, like St. James,
convey the Church's message and carry out its mis-
sion. In this court, this renders the employee "likely
to be covered by the exception." Id. By allowing the
panel majority's decision to stand, we have allowed a
61a
panel to contradict our precedent in a way that strips
the exception of its core constitutional purpose.
After Hosanna-Tabor, other circuits have placed
greater emphasis on an employee's function. See Lee
v. Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church of Pittsburgh, 903
F.3d 113, 122 n.7 (3d Cir. 2018) ("[T]he ministerial
exception applies to any claim, the resolution of
which would limit a religious institution's right to
choose who will perform particular spiritual func-
tions.") (internal quotation marks omitted);
Grussgott, 882 F.3d at 661 (finding teacher fell within
exception, noting school intended plaintiff to take on
a religious role including functions not part of a
teacher's job at a secular school); Fratello, 863 F.3d at
205 ("Where, as here, the four considerations are rel-
evant in a particular case, 'courts should focus' pri-
marily 'on the function[s] performed by persons who
work for religious bodies."' (quoting Hosanna-Tabor,
565 U.S. at 198 (Alito, J., concurring))); Cannata, 700
F.3d at 177 (applying the exception because plaintiff
performed important "function" that "furthered the
mission of the church and helped convey its mes-
sage").
Similarly, state supreme courts have emphasized
the importance of function. See Temple Emanuel of
Newton, 975 N.E.2d at 443 (holding function alone
sufficed to apply the exception); Kirby v. Lexington
Theological Seminary, 426 S.W.3d 597, 613 (Ky.
2014) (courts should focus on the "actual acts or func-
tions conducted by the employee").
B
The ministerial exception protects the "interest of
religious groups in choosing who will preach their be-
62a
liefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission."
Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 196. It "insulates a reli-
gious organization's 'selection of those who will per-
sonify its beliefs."' Puri, 844 F.3d at 1159 (quoting
Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 188). Justices Alito and
Kagan found the ministerial exception "should apply
to any 'employee' who leads a religious organization,
conducts worship services or important religious cer-
emonies or rituals, or serves as a messenger or teacher
of its faith." Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 199 (Alito,
J., concurring) (emphasis added). On many occasions,
the Court has recognized the "critical and unique role
of the teacher in fulfilling the mission of a church-
operated school." NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chi., 440
U.S. 490, 501 (1979); see also Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403
U.S. 602, 617 (1971) ("Religious authority necessarily
pervades [the Catholic] school system.").
Catholic school teachers certainly hold this special
role. See Brief of Nat'l Catholic Educ. Ass'n as Amicus
Curiae in Support of Rehearing and Rehearing En
Banc at 5-9 (schools and teachers lay at the core of
the church's ministry). According to the Vatican, the
Catholic Church founded schools "because she consid-
ers them as a privileged means of promoting the for-
mation of the whole man, since the school is a centre
in which a specific concept of the world, of man, and
of history is developed and conveyed." Id. at 5 (quot-
ing The Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education,
The Catholic School #8(5) (1977)). Teachers of reli-
gion at religious schools, regardless of title, training,
or official ordination, effectuate this purpose and car-
63a
ry out the Church's mission by ministering to stu-
dents.7
At St. James, teachers "preach" and "teach" the
school's Catholic beliefs and faith. By instructing new
generations, teachers carry out the school's mission,
precisely what a unanimous Supreme Court found
relevant. Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 192. Teachers
personify the beliefs of the school and serve a crucial
role in providing a holistic education to students.
Biel's religious duties and function as a teacher at St.
James show she was "entrusted with teaching and
conveying the tenets of the [Catholic] faith to the
next generation" and played a "substantial role in
conveying the Church's message and carrying out its
mission." Id. at 200, 204 (Alito, J., concurring) (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted). Employment decisions
relating to those who serve this function is precisely
what the ministerial exception is supposed to protect.
SThe religious nature of teachers is not unique to Catholicismin.

Our sister circuits pay closer attention to function,
particularly in religious educational settings like the
one here. See, e.g., Grussgott, 882 F.3d at 657 (Jewish
Day School teacher's role fell within "ministerial ex-
ception as a matter of law," given "[h]er integral role
in teaching her students about Judaism and the
school's motivation in hiring her, in particular,
demonstrate that her role furthered the school's reli-
gious mission"); Fratello, 863 F.3d at 208-09 (former
principal at Catholic school was a minister, empha-
sizing "function" was "the most important considera-
tion"); Conlon, 777 F.3d at 837 (finding spiritual di-
rector at Christian college educational group a minis-
ter).
Indeed, religious groups will have differing "views
on exactly what qualifies as an important religious
position, but it is nonetheless possible to identify a
general category of 'employees' whose functions are
essential to the independence of practically all reli-
gious groups." Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 200 (Alito,
J., concurring). Among such groups are "those who
are entrusted with teaching and conveying the tenets
of the faith to the next generation." Id. Biel was cer-
tainly entrusted with this duty.
The panel majority's minimized view of the reli-
gious significance of Biel's role as a teacher stands in
stark contrast to this court's view of the role of teach-
ers in secular contexts. This court recently expounded
on the instrumental role of a high school football
coach-a role "akin to being a teacher" as his "mul-
ti-faceted" job "entailed both teaching and serving as
a role model and moral exemplar," because of which
he had a "duty to use his words and expressions to
'instill[ ] values."' Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist.,
65a
869 F.3d 813, 825-27 (9th Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 139
S. Ct. 634 (2019) (citations omitted). If true at a secu-
lar public school, how much more significant the role
of an elementary school teacher at a Catholic school
who teaches religion on a daily basis?
Religion teaches morals and instills values, and
"[tlhe various characteristics of the [parochial]
schools make them a powerful vehicle for transmit-
ting the Catholic faith to the next generation." Lem-
on, 403 U.S. at 616 (internal quotation marks omit-
ted).8 Teachers effectuate this purpose, and "[w]hen it
comes to the expression and inculcation of religious
doctrine, there can be no doubt that the messenger
matters." Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.S. at 201 (Alito, J.,
concurring). This court's high view of the important
role of teachers as role models for morality in a secu-
lar public school does not square with its view that
teachers of religion at a religious school carry little
religious significance.
whatever the continuing value of the legal test in LeCmoni, the
Supreme ('ourt's recognition of the religious mission of parochi-
al schools remains unchallenged. S<ee Am. legion v. Am. /h-

Our court is now the first to issue an opinion nar-
rowing the First Amendment's ministerial exception
to apply only where an employee of a religious organ-
ization serves a significant religious function and ei-
ther bestows upon an employee a religiously signifi-
cant title (at least in a court's view), or requires the
employee to have obtained religious training.
The harmful effects of this opinion have already
emerged. In Morrissey-Berru, another panel of this
court applied Biel's rule to hold summarily in an un-
published opinion that a Catholic school teacher's
"significant religious responsibilities" were insuffi-
cient. No. 17-56624, 2019 WL 1952853, at *1. Like
Biel, Morrissey-Berru reversed a district court judge's
decision finding the exception applied. The panel
acknowledged that Morrissey-Berru
committed to incorporate Catholic values and
teachings into her curriculum, as evidenced by
several of the employment agreements she
signed, led her students in daily prayer, was in
charge of liturgy planning for a monthly Mass,
and directed and produced a performance by
her students during the School's Easter cele-
bration every year.
Id. But because Biel held that "an employee's duties
alone are not dispositive under Hosanna-Tabor's
framework," the panel concluded the exception did not
bar Morrissey-Berru's claim. Id. The case for the min-
isterial exception in Morrissey-Berru is even stronger
than in Biel given the Supreme Court's directive in
Hosanna-Tabor. Absent further review of Biel, the
implications are stark: Catholic schools in this circuit
67a
now have less control over employing its elementary
school teachers of religion than in any other area of
the country. Given our court's broad coverage, this is
not insignificant. Now thousands of Catholic schools
in the West have less religious freedom than their
Lutheran counterparts nationally. See Larson v.
Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982) ("The clearest
command of the Establishment Clause is that one re-
ligious denomination cannot be officially preferred
over another.").
V
In applying the ministerial exception, our court
should look to the function performed by employees of
religious bodies. Doing so would honor the founda-
tional protections of the First Amendment and en-
sure all religious groups are afforded the same pro-
tection.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
WESTERN DIVISION
KRISTEN BIEL,
Plaintiff, CV 15-04248 TJH (ASx)
V.
ST. JAMES SCHOOL, Amended
Defend ant. Order and Judgment
The Court has considered the St. James School's
["St. James"] motion for summary judgment, together
with the moving and opposing papers.
This motion concerns whether Plaintiff Kristen
Biel was a "minister" within the meaning of the
"ministerial exception" to Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 , 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., ["Title VII"] and
is, therefore, barred from bringing the instant action
under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.
§ 12101, et seq ["ADA"].
St. James hired Biel in 2013 as a first grade
substitute teacher. In June, 2013, Sister Mary
Margaret, St. James's principal, hired Biel as a full-
time fifth grade teacher- with the title of
"teacher" -for the 2013-14 school year. Upon
accepting the position, Biel signed an employment
contract stating that St. James's mission is "to develop
and promote a Catholic school faith community within
the philosophy of Catholic education as implemented
at St. James, and the doctrines, laws, and norms of the
Catholic Church." Further, Biel agreed to perform
"[a]ll duties and responsibilities ... within St. James's
overriding commitment to developing its faith." Under
her employment contract, Biel was required to "model,
70a
teach, and promote behavior in conformity to the
teaching of the Roman Catholic Church."
In addition to teaching secular subjects, Biel
taught a thirty-minute religion class to her students
four days per week, and was required to dedicate a
minimum of 200 minutes every week to the subject of
religion. The religion course was grounded upon the
norms and doctrines of the Catholic Faith, including
the sacraments of the Catholic Church, social
teachings according to the Catholic Church, and the
overall Catholic way of life. For instance, Biel taught
her students the significance of the Lent season, the
Last Supper, Easter, the Eucharist, and
Reconciliation. As a teaching guide for the religion
course, Biel used a Catholic textbook, entitled
"Coming to God's Life," from which Biel gave her
students weekly tests. Further, Biel was required to
pray with her students, and did so twice a day. Biel,
also, incorporated the Catholic faith into the secular
curriculum she taught. During her tenure at St.
James, Biel attended a four-to five hour conference
regarding ways to better incorporate God into lessons
at the Los Angeles Religious Education Congress.
In April, 2014, Biel was diagnosed with cancer and
informed Sister Mary Margaret. In June, 2014, Sister
Mary Margaret informed Biel that St. James would
not be renewing her contract for the 2014-2015 school
year. In June, 2015, Biel filed this suit alleging six
claims under the ADA. St. James, now, moves for
summary judgment as to all six claims.
Discussion
In a motion for summary judgment, when the
moving party has the burden of proof at trial, as St.
71a
James has here on its affirmative defense, the moving
party has the initial burden of establishing a prima
face case. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,
323 (1986). If St. James satisfies its burden, the
burden will shift to Biel to introduce evidence
sufficient to raise a triable issue. See Celotex Corp.,
477 U.S. at 323. Each fact relied upon in this Order is
undisputed.
St. James argued that Biel's claims -all brought
under the ADA, and, consequently, Title VII -are
barred under the ministerial exception. The
ministerial exception bars Title VII claims where the
employer is a religious institution and the employee is
a "minister." See Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical
Lutheran Church & Sch. v. E.E.O.C., 132 S. Ct. 694,
704 (2012) ["Hosanna-Tabor"]. The ministerial
exception is an exception to Title VII "grounded in the
First Amendment, that precludes application of such
legislation to claims concerning the employment
relationship between a religious institution and its
ministers." Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 705 (footnote
omitted). The ministerial exception "is intended to
protect the relationship between a religious
organization and its clergy from constitutionally
impermissible interference by the government." Werft
v. Desert Sw. Annual Conference of United Methodist
Church, 377 F.3d 1099. 1101 (9th Cir. 2004) (footnote
and internal quotations omitted).
Here, there is no dispute that St. James, as a
Catholic school, is a religious institution. Accordingly,
the application of the ministerial exception turns on
whether Biel was a "minister." See Hosanna-Tabor,
132 S. Ct. at 705.
72a
Whether Biel is a minister depends on all the
circumstances of Biel's employment, including her
education before and during her tenure, her title, and
her job duties. See Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 707.
"The paradigmatic application of the ministerial
exception is to the employment of an ordained
minister ...[b]ut the ministerial exception
encompasses more than a church's ordained
ministers." Alcazar v. Corporation of the Catholic
Archbishop of Seattle, 627 F.3d 1288, 1291 (2010). The
ministerial exception may apply "notwithstanding the
assignment of some secular responsibilities." Alcazar,
627 F.3d at 1293.
In Hosanna-Tabor, the teacher at a religious school
taught a forty-five minute religion class four days a
week in addition to teaching math, language arts,
social studies, science, gym, art, and music. Hosanna-
Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 700, 709. The teacher, also, led the
students in prayer and devotional exercises each day,
and attended a weekly school-wide chapel service,
which she led about twice a year. Hosanna-Tabor, 132
S. Ct. at 700. Additionally, the teacher held the title of
"called teacher," a reference to teachers at the school
who had satisfied certain academic and other
requirements, and were deemed by the school to have
"been called to their vocation by God through a
congregation." Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 700. After
taking disability leave. and subsequently losing her
position at the school, the teacher sued the school
under the ADA. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 700-01.
Upon appeal to the Supreme Court, the Court held
that the circumstances of the teacher's job -
particularly the teacher's title, the teacher's efforts to
hold herself out as a minister, and the teacher's job
73a
duties -established that the teacher was a "minister"
within the meaning of the ministerial exception.
Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 707-10. In so holding,
the Court expressly rejected the notion that the
teacher was not a minister because "her religious
duties consumed only 45 minutes of each workday,
and that the rest of her day was devoted to teaching
secular subjects." Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 709.
Here, St. James has established a prima facie case
that Biel was a minister because her employment
contract and job duties demonstrate that her "job
duties reflected a role in conveying the Catholic
Church's message and carrying out its mission." See
Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 708. Just as the plaintiff
in Hosanna-Tabor taught religion and prayed with her
students, Biel conveyed the Catholic Church's
message by teaching religion to her students four
times each week for thirty minutes, by administering
and evaluating weekly tests from a Catholic textbook,
"Coming to God's Life," and by praying with the
students twice each day. See Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.
Ct. at 700, 708. Further, Biel clearly sought to carry
out St. James's Catholic mission by, for example,
including Catholic teachings into all of her lessons and
attending a conference to learn techniques for
incorporating religious teachings into her lessons.
Although this case does not contain all of the
hallmarks of ministry identified in Hosanna-Tabor, it
is clear that Hosanna-Tabor was not intended to
represent the outer limits of the ministerial exception.
See Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S. Ct. at 707. Instead, the
question is whether the claims at issue may interfere
with St. James's ability to choose who will convey its
message. See Bollard v. California Province of the
74a
Soc'y of Jesus, 196 F.3d 940, 946 (9th Cir. 1999). For
the reasons discussed above, St. James has
established a prima face case that Biel acted as a
messenger of St. James' faith. See Hosanna-Tabor, 132
S. Ct. at 708. Therefore, St. James established a prima
facie case Biel was a minister within[ ] the meaning of
the ministerial exception.
Further, because all facts relied upon in this Order
are undisputed by the parties, Biel did not raise a
triable issue of fact that would bar the granting of
summary judgment. See Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at
323.
Therefore,
It is Ordered that the motion for summary
judgment be, and hereby is, Granted.
It is Further Ordered, Adjudged, and Decreed that
judgment be, and hereby is, Entered in favor of
Defendant St. James School and against Plaintiff
Kristen Biel.
It is Further Ordered, Adjudged, and Decreed that
Plaintiff Kristen Biel shall take nothing and that all
parties shall bear their own costs.

[DEFENDANT'S] RESPONSE: Objection: Mischar-
acterizes facts and evidence. This does not create a
genuine dispute as to any material fact because the
testimony Plaintiff presents does not controvert the
fact that the school offers kindergarten through eighth
grade with one class per grade level. Plaintiffs evi-
dence relates to two teachers having shared the first
grade which does not controvert the moving party's
fact. Plaintiff attempts to create the appearance of a
controverted fact when there isn't one here.
6. For the past 27 years, Sister Mary has been the
principal of the School. She is a vowed member of a
religious congregation of the Roman Catholic Church.

CONTROVERTED to the extent that Biel had prayer
leaders in her class room that would teach and engage
the students in daily prayer.
Deposition of Kristen Biel 25:11-15, 25:22-23
[DEFENDANT'S] RESPONSE: Objection: Mischar-
acterizes facts and evidence. This does not create a
genuine dispute as to any material fact because the
evidence presented by Plaintiff does not controvert the
moving party's fact that Plaintiff prayed Catholic
prayers with her students. Plaintiff testified that she
82a
prayed each of the prayers described above with her
students twice a day. Plaintiff attempts to create the
appearance of a controverted fact when there isn't one
here. Evidence: Biel Depo., 25:4-25:1.
21. In addition, Plaintiff attended school Mass every
month with her students where she also prayed with
them and where they occasionally presented [ER 361
the Eucharistic gifts.
(Plaintiff depo., 29:9-15, 31:20-23, 32:1-11).

22. In regards to the 5th grade curriculum, Plaintiffs
duties included incorporating the Catholic faith into
the students' every day curriculum.

30. Moreover, Plaintiff was required to incorporate
Catholic values and traditions throughout all subject
areas, not just during the Religion course.
(Kreuper decl., 1 8; Plaintiff depo., 40:15-18).
Plaintiff's Response and Supporting Evidence

31. In fact, two standard requirements included in the
School's teacher evaluation report were 1) incorporat-
84a
ing "signs, sacramental, traditions of the Roman Cath-
olic Church in the classroom," and 2) infusing "Catho-
lic values through all subject areas."
(Kreuper decl., 8; Plaintiff depo., 37:6-21, 38:17-39:8,
40:15-18).
Plaintiff's Response and Supporting Evidence
CONTROVERTED to the extent that these were two
of thirty-four different requirements on the Elemen-
tary School Classroom Observation Report
Deposition of Mary Kreuper 89:24-90:16, Exh. 3 ("Ele-
mentary School Classroom Observation Report"); Dep-
osition of Kristen Biel 37:6-37:25, Exh. 4 ("Elementary
School Classroom Observation Report")
[DEFENDANT'S] RESPONSE: Objection: Mischar-
acterizes facts and evidence. This does not create a
genuine dispute as to any material fact because the
evidence presented by Plaintiff does not controvert the
moving party's fact that the two abovementioned re-
quirements were part of the teacher evaluation re-
ports at St. James. Whether there were other require-
ments on the evaluation reports is not a material fact
and does not controvert Defendant's fact. Plaintiff at-
tempts to create the appearance of a controverted fact
when there isn't one here. Evidence: (Kreuper decl.,

48. Within two weeks of the 2013-2014 school year,
Sister Mary noticed that Plaintiff had difficulty keep-
ing her classroom organized and controlling her class-
room noise level.
(Kreuper depo., 72:16-21, 73:14-75:11, 76:23-77:5,

57:24-58:4).
Plaintiff's Response and Supporting Evidence
UNCONTROVERTED
49. Sister Mary often observed a chaotic classroom en-
vironment with clutter on and around students' desks,
and students out of their seats talking with other stu-
dents.
(Kreuper depo., 73:14-21, 74:18-75:11, 79:11-17,
101:23-102:5, 106:6-12).

76. By January 2014, Sister Mary met with Plaintiff
in her office once every week and sometimes twice a
week to discuss Plaintiffs performance issues.
(Kreuper depo., 109:7-19; Kreuper decl., $ 15; Plaintiff
depo., 44:21-45:8).
Plaintiff's Response and Supporting Evidence
CONTROVERTED
86a
The testimony cited by Defendant does not establish
that "performance issues" were the only thing dis-
cussed during these meetings as Sister Margaret tes-
tified that she wanted to "check in with her to see how
she was doing with regards to all the things" Sister
Margaret and Biel discussed.
Deposition of Mary Kreuper 109:16-109:19
For example, during these meetings, Biel and Sister
Margaret also discussed other things including Biel's
efforts to make sure the students were "understanding
and learning" in her classroom which Sister Margaret
complimented.
Deposition of Kristen Biel 45:21-47:2.
Also during these meetings Biel and Sister Margaret
discussed the large number of students who were on
Biel's honor roll during the first trimester.
Deposition of Mary Kreuper 83:24-86:14; 157:15-
157:23
[DEFENDANT'S] RESPONSE: Objection: Mischar-
acterizes facts and evidence, lacks foundation, specu-
lative, argumentative. This does not create a genuine
dispute as to any material fact because the evidence
presented by Plaintiff does not controvert the moving
party's fact that, by January 2014, Sister Mary met
with Plaintiff in her office once every week and some-
times twice a week to discuss Plaintiffs performance
issues. Plaintiffs evidence does not refute this fact.
[ER 59]
Whether other things were discussed during these
meetings is irrelevant and immaterial to the fact that
these meetings occurred every week and Plaintiffs
87a
performance issues were discussed. Plaintiffs belief
that Sister thought she was "doing a good job" is spec-
ulative and lacks foundation, and ultimately, does not
controvert the subject fact. Plaintiff attempts to create
the appearance of a controverted material fact when
there isn't one here.
[ER 69]
99. She came to this decision based on the fact that
Plaintiff failed to follow Sister Mary's guidance and
abide by the policies and procedures of the School de-
spite their numerous counseling sessions.
(Kreuper depo., 119:16-120:7, 156:17-157:1).
Plaintiff's Response and Supporting Evidence
CONTROVERTED to the extent that Biel testified
that she had her students work in the Simple Solu-
tions books.
Deposition of Kristen Biel 43:17-44:3
[DEFENDANT'S] RESPONSE: This does not create
a genuine dispute as to any material fact because
Plaintiff does not offer any evidence that controverts
the fact that Sister Mary decided to not offer Plaintiff
an employment contract based on the fact that Plain-
tiff failed to follow Sister Mary's guidance and abide
by the policies and procedures of the School despite
their numerous counseling sessions. Whether Plaintiff
had her students work in the Simple Solutions book
has no bearing on the subject fact. Plaintiff attempts
88a
to create the appearance of a controverted material
fact when there isn't one here.
100. From January 2014 to April 2014, Sister Mary
told Plaintiff on several occasions that it would be dif-
ficult to offer her an employment contract for the fol-
lowing school year.
(Kreuper depo., 120:10-121:3, 130:10-17).
Plaintiff's Response and Supporting Evidence
CONTROVERTED as Sister Margaret first testifies
that she told Biel a "couple of times" only later to say
that it was "several."
Q. Did you ever tell Ms. Biel she would not be offered
a contract prior to her going out on leave?
A. Before May 22nd. I said a couple of times, "I'm going
to find it difficult to offer you a contract."
Q. You said that a couple of times?
A. Couple of times, uh-huh.
Deposition of Mary Kreuper 120:14-120:20
Q. Did you ever tell Ms. Biel before the Monday after
Easter, when she told you she might have cancer that
she was not [ER 70] going to get a contract for the fol-
lowing school year?
A. I mentioned it on several occasions in early Janu-
ary, February when I met with her, that because of her
performance, that I was going to find it very difficult
to offer her a contract.
Deposition of Mary Kreuper 130:10-130:17.
89a
[DEFENDANT'S] RESPONSE: Objection: Mischar-
acterizes facts and evidence, argumentative. This does
not create a genuine dispute as to any material fact
because Plaintiff does not offer any evidence that con-
troverts the fact that Sister Mary told Plaintiff on sev-
eral occasions that it would be difficult to offer her an
employment contract for the following school year.
Plaintiff attempts to misconstrue Sister Mary's testi-
mony but alleging that "a couple of times" and "several
times" are conflicting testimony. This is disingenuous
and immaterial. Again, Plaintiff attempts to create the
appearance of a controverted material fact when there
isn't one here.
101. In April 2014, following Easter break, Plaintiff
told Sister Mary that she believed she had breast can-
cer and would need to undergo some tests.
(Kreuper depo., 124:14-25).
Plaintiff's Response and Supporting Evidence
CONTROVER TED to the extent that Biel had told Sis-
ter Margaret that she had cancer not that she believed
that she had cancer.
Deposition of Kristen Biel 90:23-91:25; Deposition of
Mary Kreuper 121:16-121:23; 124:14-124:25
[DEFENDANT'S] RESPONSE: Objection: Mischar-
acterizes facts and evidence, argumentative. This does
not create a genuine dispute as to any material fact
because whether Plaintiff told Sister Mary that she be-
lieved she had cancer or that she had cancer is imma-
terial. Again, Plaintiff attempts to create the appear-
ance of a controverted material fact when there isn't
one here.
90a
[ER 71]
102. Sister Mary was sympathetic to Plaintiff's situa-
tion as she was also diagnosed with breast cancer in
2010, underwent a surgical procedure to treat her con-
dition, and remained in continued treatment thereaf-
ter.
(Kreuper decl., 1 17).
Plaintiff's Response and Supporting Evidence
UNCONTROVERTED
103. Plaintiff then informed Sister Mary that May 22,
2014 would be her last day of work so that she could
receive medical treatment.
(Kreuper depo., 127:3-4, 127:14-20).
Plaintiff's Response and Supporting Evidence
CONTROVERTED as Biel continued to come to St.
James School to pick up papers to grade and check her

Deposition of Kristen Biel 23:19- 23:25; 105:25-106:18;
111:16-112:11
[DEFENDANT'S] RESPONSE: Objection: Mischar-
acterizes facts and evidence, argumentative. This does
not create a genuine dispute as to any material fact
because Plaintiff testified that her last day teaching
the 5th grade at St. James before receiving chemother-
apy treatment was approximately May 23, 2014. Evi-
dence: Biel depo., 104:23-105:6 (attached as Exhibit
C to the Fermin decl.). Whether Plaintiff continued to
grade papers and check her mailbox is immaterial and
has no bearing on the subject fact.
91a
104. Plaintiff continued to come to the School to pick
up papers to grade and check her mailbox and was
compensated until the end of the school year.

[ER 2221
[BY MS. FERMIN:]
Q. Are you claiming that St. James School owes you
unpaid wages?
A. Again, the same question. I'm sorry. I'm not sure.
I'd have to check my records.
Q. What records would you check?
A. My last paycheck stub.
Q. St. James is a Catholic School. Right?
A. Yes.
Q. Are you Catholic?
A. Yes.
Q. Was it your understanding that as a Catholic school
St. James had the goal of incorporating the faith into
their curriculum?
A. Yes.
Q. As a Catholic school St. James promoted and
developed the Catholic faith amongst its elementary
school students?
A. Are you asking me to agree?
Q. Is that your understanding?
A. Yes.
93a
Q. As a teacher at St. James your duties encompassed
promoting and furthering the Catholic faith amongst
your students?
MS. SHOEMAKER: Objection; vague and ambiguous.
BY MS. FERMIN:
[ER 223]
Q. Is that your understanding?
A. What do you mean by "promoting and furthering"?
Q. Incorporating it into the curriculum.
A. We prayed every day, yes.
Q. You prayed with your students?
A. Yes.
Q. In the morning or at the end of the day?
A. Both.
Q. Twice a day?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you teach your students any Catholic prayers?
A. They already know them. I didn't need to teach
them anything. And I had prayer leaders. The prayers
that were said in the classroom were said mostly by
the students. We had prayer leaders. That was like a
job.
Q. Did you pray the Hail Mary with your students?
A. We did.
Q. The Lord's Prayer?
A. We did, yes.
Q. Those are Catholic prayers, aren't they?
94a
A. Hail Mary is.
Q. The Lord's Prayer is not a Catholic prayer?
A. It's a Christian prayer.
Q. But used in mass. Right?
A. Yes, but used in mass of other Christian

Q. -of the Eucharist and confession?
A. That was in the book, yes. But the kids -I'm sorry.
Never mind.
Q. Did you give tests based on this religious workbook?
A. Yes.
Q. How often would you give tests?
A. Weekly.
Q. Did you ever attend mass with your students?
A. Yes.
Q. Where was mass held?
A. It was kind of a multi-purpose room.
Q. It was school mass, I'm assuming.
A. Yes. The church and the school are not connected.
Q. So it was a mass just with the St. James students?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. How often did school mass take place?
A. Once a month.
Q. You attended the school mass with your students?
95a
A. Yes.
MS. FERMIN: I'm going to mark this as Exhibit No. 2.

Q. Did you go over with your students on how to
present the gifts in mass?
A. As far as rehearsal? I don't think we did rehearsal.
Most of them know how to do it already.
Q. So you did not go over how to present gifts?
A. I don't remember. Maybe we quickly did something,
or not. I don't remember. It wasn't that often.
Q. Just for the record, when you say "gifts," you are
referring to the Eucharist. Right?
A. Yes.
Q. How often would your class present the gifts at
school mass?
A. It was only twice a year.
Q. That they would present the gifts?
A. Yes, something like that. Not very often. It was kind
of a volunteer thing if the kids wanted to do it.
Q. During these school masses you mentioned that you
made sure that the kids were quiet and sitting down
and behaving during mass. Right?
A. Yes.
Q. Did your students pray during school mass?
A. Yes.
96a
Q. Did you pray too?
A. Yes.

you are unable to perform the essential functions
of your position and reasonable accommodation is

7. Renewal. Future employment will be determined
on a year-to-year basis. It is agreed that you will give
written notice to the School, on or before April 1, 20__

or before May 15, 20__, stating whether or not it
intends to renew the Agreement for the following year.
In the absence of a notice by either party, this
agreement will lapse under its own terms. The
Principal alone, with the approval of the Pastor, has
the final and sole authority with respect to offering
contracts. This Agreement is contingent upon
sufficient School enrollment and the School's financial
condition. If the enrollment or the School's financial
condition does not justify the staffing, the Principal
has discretionary power to make decisions regarding
personnel reduction including, but not limited to,
modification or cancellation of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding this, if the School closes for any
reason, this Agreement will be considered terminated
on the date of the closure. You understand that tenure
is not granted by Archdiocesan Schools and upon
expiration or termination of the Agreement fox any
reason you shall have no right to [ER 2801
employment or preferential treatment regarding
employment at any other Archdiocesan School. There
is no implied duty by you or the School to renew this
Agreement, and no cause whatsoever is required by
either party for non-renewal. Any other arrangement

employment is valid only if in writing, executed by you
and the Principal, with the approval of the Pastor.
8. Severability. If, for any reason, any one or more of
the provisions of this Agreement shall beheld or
deemed to be legally invalid or unenforceable, that
shall not have any effect on any of the other provisions
of this Agreement, all of which shall remain in full
force and effect.
102a
9. Entire Agreement. This agreement and the
attached Compensation and Benefits Supplement
contain the complete and entire agreement between
you and the School, and it supersedes all prior offers,
agreements, commitments, understandings, whether
oral or written. No changes to this Agreement maybe
made except by a document signed by you and the
Principal, with approval of the Pastor.
10. Applicable Law. This Agreement is entered into
under, and governed by, the laws of the State of
California.
11. Dispute Resolution and Grievances. You and
the School agree to attempt to resolve any disputes in
good faith. Any unresolved dispute between you and
the School arising out of or in any way related to your
employment or the termination thereof, shall be
subject to the Grievance Procedures promulgated by
the Archdiocesan Department of Catholic Schools and
no legal actions may be taken until all procedures have
been fully discharged. This clause is intended to
provide a speedy, economical and exclusive forum for
resolving claims; its existence shall not imply any
limitations upon the School's right to manage its
affairs or terminate any employment.

condition precedent of this Agreement is the receipt of
the Criminal Record Summary report from the

virtue who give fine personal example at all times.
They are expected to maintain professional excellence
and personal integrity, just as we would like our
students to strive for these.
* * *
School Masses
School-wide and grade level Masses are scheduled
throughout the year. Teachers prepare their students
to be active participants at Mass, with particular
emphasis on Mass responses.
Each class participates in a special way at one Sunday
liturgy during the school year (at the 10:00 AM Mass
on the first Sunday of the month). Students are
prepared for special participation in that Mass.
Teachers are encouraged to attend this Mass each
month, especially when their students are
participating.
11Oa
School Day Masses at St. James Church /Drivers
On occasion students attend Mass at St. James
Church (e.g., before rehearsals for the Christmas
Program and Spring Sing). At these times,
students are dropped off at Church at 7:45 a.m.
and need transportation back to school at
approximately recess time. Teachers and/or room
parents need to coordinate parent drivers for their
students. A permission slip is signed at the
beginning of the school year to cover all trips from
Church.
[ER 589]
Daily Prayer
The school day should begin and end with prayer. A
prayer should also be said before and after lunch.
Students should know and frequently use the prayers
in the back of their religion book.
Students should also know the following prayers and
be prepared to pray them at the school's morning
assembly. See end pages of this handbook.

Volume I
Kristen Biel v. St. James School,
No. 2:15-cv-04248 (TJH) (ASx)
(C.D. Cal. Jan. 28, 2016)
[ER 8341 [Tr. 201
BY MS. SHOEMAKER:
Q. Do you remember the school year when Ms. Biel
began teaching the fifth grade, what year that was?
A. No. It was -well, what -like was it three years ago?
One, two, three. I don't remember.
Q. We've alleged that it occurred in 2013 to 2014.
A. Okay.
Q. Does this seem about right?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Yes?
A. Yes.
Q. And at that time, M[redacted] was in her class; is
that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And during that 2013 to 2014 school year, did you
personally observe any problems with Ms. Biel's
teaching?
MR. VASIN: I'm just going to object as overly broad,
vague, ambiguous.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
112a
[ER 835] [Tr. 21]
BY MS. SHOEMAKER:
Q. And what were those issues?
A. One, their calculators were being used for math. I
had a problem with study guides not being corrected.
I had a problem with the math workbook not being
used. I had a problem with the use of the Simple
Solution math workbooks, the classroom environment
and I guess that the work not being challenging.
Q. Any other problems you can think of?
A. Not at this second.
Q. You said one of the problems was that they were
using calculators for math?
A. Yes.
Q. What's the issue with that?
A. Long division. So this is -I mean, fifth grade
usually calculators aren't used. So it was just the type
of problems the calculators were being used for.
Q. And then you said something about having issues
with the study guides?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. What do you mean by that?
A. The students were given study guides after they
completed a chapter. She was passing out the study
guides, giving them class time to finish them but then
never going back to correct the answer. So then when
my [Tr. 221 daughter would bring the study guides to
prepare for a test, they didn't have the correct answers
on it. So then as a present, I was going back looking in
113a
the book trying to fix -find the correct answers so that
I could help her study.
Q. And what book were you looking in?
A. This was social studies.
Q. A teacher book? Your daughter's school book?
A. No, my daughter's school book.
Q. To see -to see if the answers she had in the study
guide was correct?
A. Correct.
Q. So it's not like you had the teacher manual readily
available?
A. No.
Q. And then you mentioned an issue with the math
workbooks?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. What was that?
A. Our math workbook supplements our textbook and
she was not using the math book. So they weren't
having homework to reinforce the math skills that
they were being taught during the day.
Q. So the issue was that the supplements weren't
being used?
[Tr. 231
A. Correct.
Q. And what about the Simple Solutions books?
A. She -it's a consumable math workbook and they
were not using it as a consumable. So they were using
a piece of paper but then she would go -so the kids
114a
were doing it on paper -So then when the kids would
have a test on it, there was no work in the workbook
for the parents to review or you'd --
Q. Go ahead.
A. So you couldn't find your child's mistake or help
them with a mistake.
Q. And what's a consumable?
A. You write on it. So like your textbook you would not
write in. We can't -we don't highlight our books but a
workbook is consumable because you write in it.
Q. And if it was on loose leaf paper, it'd be hard to keep
all that work together?
A. Uh-huh, and I don't even think they had -they got
those back.
Q. The?
A. The loose leaf papers.
Q. And you mentioned you had an issue with the
classroom environment?
A. Uh-huh.
[Tr. 24]
Q. And what do you mean by that?
A. Very loud, noisy, sometimes I'd walk by and there'd
be kids just, you know, walking or crawling on the
floor. And just with their desks, they had taped pencil
holders and things around their desk and just books
on the -in the aisle.
Q. How close was your classroom to Ms. Biel's
classroom?
115a
A. We were separated by let's see, one, two, I think
three classrooms.
Q. Could you hear noise from her classroom when you
were in your classroom?
A. No.
MR. VASIN: You answered the question.
THE WITNESS: Okay.
BY MS. SHOEMAKER:
Q. So when you state that the classroom was loud or
noisy, you only heard this when you walked by the
classroom; is that correct?
A. When I walked by or when I was in the computer
lab.
Q. And where is the computer lab in reference to her
classroom?
A. Right next door.
[ER 8361 [Tr. 371
Q. Any other students?
A. Not that I remember.
Q. And how many conversations did you have with
A.W. about issues with Ms. Biel's teaching?
A. I drove to soccer practice with them in my car. So if
I had -if M[redacted] came home using her calculator
in the car, I would say, is it true that you're allowed to
use your calculator? And then how -how are you able
to use your calculator? The kids would talk about
things that happened during the day. So I would just
116a
get in on the conversation and ask questions about,
you know, the events.
Q. Was F.D. also in the car with these drives to soccer
practice?
A. Not all of them.
Q. Is that where the conversations with F.D. would
have taken place?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you recall discussing any issues, other than the
one you previously told me about?
A. No.
Q. And approximately how many times did you have
these conversations?
A. I don't know. September, October, November.
[Tr. 38] Maybe 12 conversations. If I drove -if I had
to drive extra carpool, I mean, there would have been
more.
Q. Did you have -- ever have any conversations about
the issues with Ms. Biel's teaching with Sister Mary
Margaret?
A. Yes.
Q. And approximately how many conversations did
you have with her?
A. Probably about three.
Q. Do you remember when the first conversation took
place?
A. It would have been sometime in the first trimester.
Q. And what was said in that conversation?
117a
A. I don't -I don't recall what specifically we talked
about.
Q. What do you recall generally speaking about?
A. I know I spoke to her about three things. We talked
about the math workbooks not being used. I talked to
her about M[redacted]'s progress report. I discussed
the study guides with her and the math workbook.
Q. When do progress reports come out for the
students?
A. Midway through the trimester. The first one comes
out about Thanksgiving.

[ER 839]
Q. Okay: When does the school year start?
A. August, end of August we start with meetings.
Q. And it goes to what month?
A. Halfway through June.
Q. During Kristen Biel's first year teaching as a fifth
grade teacher, did you meet once a week from August
through June with her?
A. No, she didn't finish out the year.
Q. Until she left in May, did you meet with her once
per week?
A. Yes, unless it wasn't possible because of different
schedules people had.
Q. From that time August through May that you were
meeting with her once per week, was there any specific
topic that was often discussed or a certain issue that
[ER 8401 she had that you had to go over multiple
times with her?
A. I talked with her at the beginning of the year about
behavior problems that I knew she was having, you
know. I asked her questions because she had come to
me about things. The other one was her classroom
maintenance.
121a
Q. When you say behavior problems, what do you
mean?
A. The children were often out of control.
Q. What do you mean by out of control?
A. Not working, sometimes outside of the classroom,
having behavior problems, different things.
Q. Would they ever get in physical altercations?
A. No, but that's not-that doesn't happen at our
school, so...
Q. What do you mean, then, with problems outside the
classroom?
A. Where the children wouldn't be following rules and
there would be different problems that I saw, other
people saw, and I talked with her about them.
